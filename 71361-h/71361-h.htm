<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</span></p>

<p>I feel like a starved man who is so bewildered
by the first sight of food that he wants to grab
and devour the ice-cream, the roast and the
entrée all in one gulp. For ages and ages, my
people in Russia had no more voice than the
broomstick in the corner. The poor had no
more chance to say what they thought or felt
than the dirt under the feet.</p>

<p>And here, in America, a miracle has happened
to me. I can lift up my head like a person.
After centuries of suppression I am allowed to
speak. Is it a wonder that I am too excited to
know where to begin?</p>

<p>All the starved, unlived years crowd into my
throat and choke me. I don’t know whether it
is joy or sorrow that hurts me so. I only feel
my release is wrung with the pain of all those
back of me who lived and died, their dumbness
pressing down on them like stories on the heart.</p>

<p>My mother, who dried out her days fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
at the pushcarts for another potato, another onion
into the bag, wearing out her heart and soul and
brain with the one unceasing worry—how to get
food for the children a penny cheaper—and my
father, a Hebrew scholar and dreamer who was
always too much up in the air to come down to
such sordid thoughts as bread and rent, and the
lost and wasted lives of my brothers and sisters
and my grandfather and grandmother, and all
those dumb generations back of me, are crying
in every breath of every word that is struggling
itself out of me.</p>

<p>I am the mad mob at a mass meeting, shouting,
waving with their hands and stamping with
their feet, to their leader: “Speech! Speech!”
And I am also the bewildered leader struggling to
say something and make myself heard through the
deafening noise of a thousand clamouring voices.</p>

<p>I envy the writers who can sit down at their
desks in the clear, calm security of their vision
and begin their story at the beginning and work it
up logically, step by step, till they get to the end.</p>

<p>With me, the end and the middle and the
beginning of my story whirl before me in a mad
blur. And I cannot sit still inside myself till
the vision becomes clear and whole and sane in
my brain. I’m too much on fire to wait till I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
understand what I see and feel. My hands rush
out to seize a word from the end, a phrase from
the middle, or a sentence from the beginning.
I jot down any fragment of a thought that I
can get hold of. And then I gather these fragments,
words, phrases, sentences, and I paste
them together with my own blood.</p>

<p>Think of the toil it takes to wade through a
dozen pages that you must cut down into one
paragraph. Sometimes the vivisection I must
commit on myself to create one little living
sentence leaves me spent for days.</p>

<p>I thought when the editor asked me to write
mostly about myself, telling of my own life, it
would be so simple the thing would write itself.
And just look at me at my desk! Before me
are reams of jumbled pages of madness and
inspiration, and I am trying to make a little
sense of it all.</p>

<p>What shall I keep, and what shall I throw
away? Which is madness, and which is inspiration?
I never know. I pick and choose things
like a person feeling his way in the dark. I
never know whether the thoughts I’ve discarded
are not perhaps better than the thoughts I’ve
kept. With all the physical anguish I put into
my work, I am never sure of myself. But I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
sure of this, that the utterance of the ignorant
like me is something like the utterance of the
dying. It’s mixed up and incoherent, but it has
in it the last breath of life and death.</p>

<p>I am learning to accept the torture of chaos
and confusion and doubt through which my
thoughts must pass, as a man learns to accept a
hump on his back, or the loss of an arm, or any
affliction which the fates thrust upon him.</p>

<p>I am learning, as I grow older, to be tolerant
with my own inadequacy. I am learning slowly
to stop wasting myself trying to make myself over
on the pattern of some better organized, more
educated person than I am. I no longer waste
precious time wishing for the brains of a George
Eliot, or the fluency of a George Sand, or the
marvellous gift of words of a May Sinclair.
Here I am as I am, and life is short and work
is long. With this limited brain of my inadequate
self I must get the most work done. I
can only do the best I can and leave the outcome
in the hands of the Higher Powers.</p>

<p>I am aware that there’s a little too much of
I—I—I, too much of self-analysis and introspection
in my writing. But this is because I
was forced to live alone with myself so much.
I spent most of my youth at work I hated, work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
which called only for the use of the hands, the
strength of my body—not my heart, not my
brain. So my thoughts, instead of going out
naturally to the world around me, were turned
in upon myself.</p>

<p>I look upon my self-analysis and introspection
as so much dirt through which I have to dig
before I can come into the light of objectivity
and see the people of the worlds around me.</p>

<p>Writing is to me a confession—not a profession.
I know a man, a literary hack who calls
himself a dealer in words. He can write to
order on any subject he is hired to write about.
I often marvel at the swift ease with which he
can turn from literary criticism to politics, or
psycho-analysis. A fatal fluency enables him
to turn out thousands of words a day in the
busy factory of his brain, without putting
anything of himself into it.</p>

<p>But I can never touch the surfaces of things.
I can only write from the depths. I feel myself
always under the aching weight of my thoughts.
And words are luring lights that beckon to me
through the thick mist of vague, dumb thoughts
that hang over me and press down on me.</p>

<p>I am so in love with the changing lights and
shades of words that I almost hate their power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
over me, as you hate the tyranny of the people
you love too much. I almost hate writing,
because I love so passionately to express the
innermost and outermost of my thoughts and
feelings. And the words I write are never what
I started out to express, but what came out of
my desire for expression.</p>

<p>Often I read my own writing as though it
were somebody else’s. My own words mock at
me with their glaring unreality. Where is that
burning vividness of things that possessed me
when I began? Why did I kill myself so for
nothing? Are these stiff, stilted words me?</p>

<p>I stare at the pages that represent so many
days and nights of labour more bitter, more
violent, than childbirth. What has happened?
Has my terrific passion for giving out my experiences
only built a barrier of barren words
against the experience that I held so close?</p>

<p>It’s as if every kiss, every embrace of the
lover and the beloved instead of fusing them
into a closer oneness only drew them farther and
farther apart. Every written word instead of
bringing the vision nearer only pushed it farther
and farther away.</p>

<p>But the sense of failure never stops me. It
only spurs my sleeping senses with ever new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
inexhaustible energy to do the one thing over
and over and over again till I touch nearer the
edge of that flaming reality just beyond reach.</p>

<p>Writing is ordinarily the least part of a man.
It is all there is of me. I want to write with
every pulse of my blood and every breath of
my spirit. I want to write waking or dreaming,
year in and year out. I burn up in this all-consuming
desire my family, my friends, my
loves, my clothes, my food, my very life.</p>

<p>And yet the minute my writing gets into
print I hate the sight of it. I have all the
patience in the world to do over a page a thousand
times. But the moment it gets out of my
hand I can’t bear to touch it with a pitchfork.
The minute a manuscript gets into print it’s all
dead shells of the past to me.</p>

<p>I know some people who hate the books I
write, and because they hate my books they hate
me. I want to say to them now that I, too, hate
the stuff I write. Can’t we be friends and make
the mutual hatred of my books a bond instead
of a barrier? My books are not me.</p>

<p>Is this a contradiction of anything I said in
the page above? I do not claim to be logical
or consistent. I do not claim to think things
out; I only feel out my feelings, and the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
thing true about feelings is that they change and
become different in the very process of utterance.
The minute I say a thing with the absolute
sincerity of my being, up rushes another thought
that hits my most earnest sincerity in the face
and shows it up for a lie.</p>

<p>I am alive, and the only thing real in my aliveness
is the vitality of unceasing change. Sometimes
I wake up in the morning with a fresh new
thought that sweeps out of the window all of the
most precious thoughts of the day before.</p>

<p>Perhaps by the time I shall have reached the
end of this little sketch I shall have refuted every
statement I tried to make at the beginning. I
cannot help it. I am not attempting to write a
story to fit into the set mould of a magazine.
I am trying to give you the changing, baffling,
contradictory substance of which my life is made.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I remember my mother’s ecstatic face when
she burst into the house and announced proudly
that, though she never had had a chance to learn
the alphabet, she could read the names of the
streets and she could find her way to the free
dispensary without having to be led by us.</p>

<p>“I’m no longer blind,” she cried, tossing up
her market basket in a gesture of triumph. “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
signs of the streets are like pictures before my
eyes. Delancey Street has the black hooks one
way, and Essex Street has black hooks the other
way.” She tore off her blue-checked apron.
“I can also be a lady and walk without having
to beg people to show me the way.”</p>

<p>Something of my mother’s wonder was mine
when, without knowing the first alphabet of
literature, I had discovered that Beauty was
anywhere a person tries to think out his thoughts.
Beauty was no less in the dark basement of a
sweat-shop than in the sunny, spacious halls of
a palace. So that I, buried alive in the killing
blackness of poverty, could wrest the beauty of
reality out of my experiences no less than the
princess who had the chance to live and love
and whose only worry was which of her adorers
should she choose for a husband.</p>

<p>I did not at first think it as clearly as I write
it now. In fact, I did not think then at all. I
only felt. And it gave me a certain power over
the things that weighed over me, merely saying
out on paper what I felt about them.</p>

<p>My first alphabet of self-expression was
hatred, wrath and rebellion. Once during lunch-hour
while the other girls in the shop were eating
and talking and laughing, I wrote out on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
greasy lunch-bag the thoughts that were boiling
in me for a long, long time.</p>

<p>“I hate beautiful things,” I began. “All
day long I handle beautiful clothes, but not for
me—only for others to wear. The bloated rich
with nothing but cold cash can buy the beautiful
things made with the sweat of my hands, while
I choke in ugliness.” Merely writing out the
wildness running through my head enabled me
to wear the rags I had to wear with a certain
bitter defiance.</p>

<p>But after a while, raving at things in the air
ceased to bring me relief. I felt a little like my
mother yelling and cursing at the children and
the worries around her without knowing what or
where. I felt like a woman standing in the
middle of her upset house in the morning—beds
not made, dishes not washed, dirty clothes and
rags hanging over the chairs, all the drawers
pushed out in mixed-up disorder, the broom
with the dirt in the middle of the floor—and
she not knowing where to begin.</p>

<p>I wanted order, order in my head. But then
I was too mixed up with too many thoughts to
put anything in its place. In a blind sort of
way, in groping for order I was groping for
beauty. I felt no peace in what I wrote unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
I could make my words laugh and cry with the
life of the poor I was living. I was always
digging, digging for the beauty that I sensed
back of the dirt and the disorder. Until I could
find a way to express the beauty of that reality
there was no rest in me. Like the woman who
makes the beds or sweeps the house and lets
the rest go, so I took hold of one idea at a time
and pushed all the other ideas out of my head.
And day and night I burned up my body and
brain with that one idea till it got light all around
me—the light of an idea that shaped itself in a
living picture of living people.</p>

<p>When I saw my first story in print I felt
bigger than Columbus who discovered the New
World. I felt bigger than the man who built
Brooklyn Bridge or the highest skyscraper in
New York. I walked the streets, holding the
magazine tight in my hands, laughing and crying
to myself: “I had an idea and I thought it out.
I did it, I did it! I’m not a crazy fool, I’m not
a crazy fool!”</p>

<p>But the next day all my fiery gladness turned
cold. I saw how far from the whole round circle
of the idea was my printed story. And I was
burning to do the same thing over again from
another side, to show it up more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>Critics have said that I have but one story
to tell, and that I tell that one story in different
ways each time I write. That is true. My one
story is hunger. Hunger driven by loneliness.</p>

<p>But is not all of human life but the story of
our hunger, our loneliness? What is at the root
of economics, sociology, literature and all art
but man’s bread hunger and man’s love hunger?</p>

<p>When I first started to write I could only
write one thing—different phases of the one
thing only—bread hunger. At last I’ve written
out my bread hunger. And now I can write
only the different phases of the one thing only—loneliness,
love hunger, the hunger for people.</p>

<p>In the days of poverty I used to think there
was no experience that tears through the bottom
of the earth like the hunger for bread. But now
I know, more terrible than the hunger for bread
is the hunger for people.</p>

<p>I used to be more hungry after a meal than
before. Years ago, the food I could afford to buy
only whetted my appetite for more food. Sometimes
after I had paid down my last precious
pennies for a meal in one of those white-tiled
restaurants, I’d get so mad with hunger I’d want
to dash the empty dishes at the heads of the
waiters and cry out like a lunatic: “Don’t feed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
me with plates and forks and tablecloths. I want
real food. I want to bite into huge chunks of meat.
I want butter and quarts of milk and eggs—dozens
of eggs. I want to fill up for once in my life.”</p>

<p>This unacted madness used to be always flying
through my brain, morning, noon and night.
Whenever I wanted to think, my thoughts were
swept away by the sight of thick, juicy steaks and
mounds of butter and platters full of eggs.</p>

<p>Now I no longer live in a lonely hall-room in
a tenement. I have won many friends. I am
invited out to teas and dinners and social affairs.
And I wonder, is my insatiable hunger for people
so great because for so many centuries my race
has been isolated in Ghettos, shut out of contact
with others? Here in America for the first time
races, classes and creeds are free to meet and
mingle on planes as high and wide as all
humanity and its problems. And I am aching
to touch all the different races, classes and creeds
at all possible points of contact, and I never seem
to have enough of people.</p>

<p>When I first came to America the coldness
of the Americans used to rouse in me the fury
of a savage. Their impersonal, non-committal
air was like a personal insult to me. I longed
to shake them out of their aloofness, their frozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
stolidity. But now when I meet an Anglo-Saxon
I want to cry out to him: “We’re friends, we’re
friends, I tell you! We understand the same
things, even though we seem to be so different
on the outside.”</p>

<p>Sometimes a man and a woman are so different
that they hate each other at first sight.
Their intense difference stabs a sharp sword of
fear into each heart. But when this fear that
froze each into his separate oppositeness ever
has a chance for a little sun of understanding,
then the very difference that drew them apart
pulls them closer than those born alike. Perhaps
that accounts for the devouring affinity
between my race and the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In my early childhood my people hammered
into me defeat, defeat, because that was the way
they accepted the crushing weight of life. Life
had crushed my mother, so without knowing it
she fed defeat with the milk of her bosom into
the blood and bone of her children. But this
thing that stunted the courage, the initiative, of
the other children roused the fighting devils in me.</p>

<p>When yet barely able to speak, I began to
think and question the justice of the world around
me and to assert my rights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“Mamma,” I asked out of a clear sky, “why
does Masha Stein have butter on her bread every
morning, and why is our bread always hard and
dry, and nothing on it?”</p>

<p>“Butter wills itself in you!” shrieked my
mother, as she thrust the hash of potato peelings
in front of me for my noonday meal. “Have
you got a father a business man, a butcher or a
grocer, a breadgiver, like Masha Stein’s father?
You don’t own the dirt under Masha’s doorstep.
You got a father a scholar. He holds himself
all day with God; he might as well hang the
beggar’s bag on his neck and be done with it.”</p>

<p>At the time I had no answer. I was too
young to voice my revolt against my mother’s
dark reasoning. But the fact that I did not
forget this speech of so many years ago shows
how her black pessimism cut against my grain.</p>

<p>I have a much clearer memory of my next
rebellion against the thick gloom in which my
young years were sunk.</p>

<p>“Mamma, what’s a birthday?” I cried, bursting
into the house in a whirl of excitement.
“Becky, the pawnbroker’s girl on the block, will
have a birthday to-morrow. And she’ll get
presents for nothing, a cake with candles on it,
and a whole lot of grand things from girls for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
nothing—and she said I must come. Could I
have a birthday, too, like she?”</p>

<p>“Woe is to me!” cried my mother, glaring
at me with wet, swollen eyes. “A birthday lays
in your head? Enjoyments lays in your head?”
she continued bitterly. “You want to be glad
that you were born into the world? A whole lot
you got to be glad about. Wouldn’t it be better
if you was never born already?”</p>

<p>At the harsh sound of my mother’s voice all
my dreams took wing. In rebellion and disappointment
I thrust out my lips with a trembling
between retort and tears. It was as if the devil
himself urged my mother thus to avenge herself
upon her helpless children for the aches and
weariness of her own life. So she went on, like
a horse bolting downhill, feeling the pressure
of the load behind him.</p>

<p>“What is with you the great joy? That you
ain’t got a shirt on your back? That you ain’t
got no shoes on your feet? Why are you with
yourself so happy? Is it because the landlord
sent the moving bill, and you’ll be laying in the
street to-morrow, already?”</p>

<p>I had forgotten that we had received a notice
of eviction, for unpaid rent, a few days before.
A frenzy of fear had taken possession of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
mother as she anticipated the horror of being
thrown into the street. For hours at a time I
would see her staring at the wall with the glassy
stare of a madwoman.</p>

<p>“With what have you to be happy, I ask
only?” she went on. “Have you got money laying
in the bank? Let the rich people enjoy themselves.
For them is the world like made to order.
For them the music plays. They can have birthdays.
But what’s the world to the poor man?
Only one terrible, never-stopping fight with the
groceryman and the butcher and the landlord.”</p>

<p>I gazed at my mother with old, solemn eyes,
feeling helplessly sucked into her bitterness and
gloom.</p>

<p>“What’s a poor man but a living dead one?”
she pursued, talking more to herself than to me.
“You ought to light a black candle on your
birthday. You ought to lie on your face and
cry and curse the day you was born!”</p>

<p>Crushed by her tirade, I went out silently.
The fairy dream of the approaching birthday
had been rudely shattered. Blinded with tears,
I sat down on the edge of the gutter in front of
our tenement.</p>

<p>“Look, these are the pink candles for the
birthday cake!” A poke in the back from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Becky startled me. “Aren’t they grand? And
mamma will buy me a French doll, and papa
said he’d give me a desk, and my aunt will give
me a painting set, and every girl that comes
will bring me something different.”</p>

<p>“But what’s the use?” I sobbed. “I ain’t
got nothing for no present, and I can’t come—and
my mother is so mean she got mad and
hollered like hell because I only asked her about
the birthday, and——”</p>

<p>A passionate fit of sobbing drowned my words.</p>

<p>In an instant Becky had her arms about me.
“I want you to come without a present,” she
said. “I will have a lot of presents, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Assured of her welcome I went the next day.
But as I opened the door fear seized me. I
paused trembling, holding the knob in my hand,
too dazed by the sight before me to make a step.
More than the strangeness of the faces awed me.
Ordinary home comforts, cushioned chairs, green
ferns between white curtains, the bright rugs on
the floor were new and wonderful to me. Timorously
I edged my way into the room, so blinded
by the shimmering colours of the cakes and fruits
and candies that covered the table that I did not
see Becky approaching me with outstretched
arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Mamma, this is that little immigrant girl
who never had a birthday,” she said, “so I
wanted to show her mine.”</p>

<p>Becky’s father glanced at her all in white,
with pink ribbons on her curls, as she stood
beside me in my torn rags reeking with the
grime of neglect. A shudder of revulsion went
through him at the sight of me.</p>

<p>“See what Becky has to mix up with on the
block,” he whispered to his wife. “For God’s
sake, give her a nickel, give her some candy,
give her anything, but let her run along.”</p>

<p>Street child that I was, my instinct sensed
the cold wave of his thought without hearing
the exact words. Breaking away from Becky’s
detaining hand I made for the door.</p>

<p>“I want to go home! I want to go home!”
I sobbed as I ran out of the room.</p>

<p>Whitman has said, “It is as lucky to die as
it is to be born.” And I put his thought into
my own words, “It is as lucky not to have
advantages as it is to have them.” I mean that
facing my disadvantages—the fears, the discouragements,
the sense of inferiority—drove
me to fight every inch of the way for things I
demanded out of life. And, as a writer, the
experience of forcing my way from the bottomest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
bottom gave me the knowledge of the poor that
no well-born writer could possibly have.</p>

<p>I am thinking, for instance, of Victor Hugo
and his immortal book, “Les Misérables.” It’s
great literature, but it isn’t the dirt and the
blood of the poor that I saw and that forced me
to write. Or take the American, Jack London:
when he wrote about tramps he roused the sense
of reality in his readers, because he had been a
tramp. But later, when he tried to make stories
of the great unwashed of the cities—again this
was only literature.</p>

<p>The clear realization that literature is beyond
my reach, that I must either be real or nothing,
enables me to accept my place as the cobbler who
must stick to his last, and gives my work any
merit it may have. I stand on solid ground when
I write of the poor, the homeless and the hungry.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Like many immigrants who expected to find
America a realized Utopian dream, I had my disillusions.
I quote here from an article which was
published in <i>Good Housekeeping</i> in June, 1920.</p>

<hr class="tb">
<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the editor told me that he would give
me the chance to speak to the Americans out of
my heart and say freely, not what I ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
feel—not what the Americans want me to feel—but
what I actually do feel—something broke
loose in me—a tightness that had held me
strained like one whose fists are clenched—resisting—resisting——</p>

<p>Resisting what? Had I not come to America
with open, outstretched arms, all my earthly possessions
tied up in a handkerchief and all the
hopes of humanity singing in my heart?</p>

<p>Had I not come to join hands with all those
thousands of dreamers who had gone before me
in search of the Golden Land? As I rushed
forward with hungry eagerness to meet the expected
welcoming, the very earth danced under
my feet. All that I was, all that I had, I held
out in my bare hands to America, the beloved,
the prayed-for land.</p>

<p>But no hand was held out to meet mine. My
eyes burned with longing—seeking—seeking
for a comprehending glance. Where are the
dreamers? cried my heart. My hands dropped
down, my gifts unwanted.</p>

<p>I found no dreamers in America. I found
rich men, poor men, educated men, ignorant men—struggling—all
struggling—for bread, for rent,
for banks, for mines. Rich and poor, educated and
ignorant—straining—straining—wearing out their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
bodies, their brains, for the possession of things—money,
power, position—their dreams forgotten.</p>

<p>I found in this rich land man still fighting
man, as in the poorest part of the old country.
Just as the starving Roumanian Jews, who had
nothing to eat in their homeland but herring,
when they became millionaires still ate herring
from gold plates at banquets, so, throughout
America, the dollar fight that grew up like a
plague in times of poverty, killing the souls of
men, still goes on in times of plenty.</p>

<p>I had expected to work in America, but work
at the thing I loved—work with my mind, my
heart, prepared for my work by education. I
had dreamed of free schools, free colleges, where
I could learn to give out my innermost thoughts
and feelings to the world. But no sooner did
I come off the ship than hunger drove me to the
sweatshop, to become a “hand”—not a brain—not
a soul—not a spirit—but just a “hand”—cramped,
deadened into a part of a machine—a
hand fit only to grasp, not to give.</p>

<p>Time came when I was able to earn my bread
and rent. I earned what would have been wealth
to me in Poland. My knotted nerves relaxed. I
begun to breathe like a free human being. Ach!
Maybe I could yet be at home in America. Maybe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
I could yet make something of myself. My
choked-in spirit revived. There was a new light
in my eyes, new strength in my arms and fingers.
New hopes, new dreams beckoned to me. Should
I take a night course in college, or buy myself
the much-longed-for books, or treat myself to a
little vacation to have time to think?</p>

<p>Then the landlady came with the raise in
rent. The loaf of bread that was five cents
became ten. Milk that was eight cents a quart
became eighteen. Shoes, clothes, everything
doubled and tripled in price. I felt like one
put on a rack—thumb-screws torturing my flesh—pay—pay—pay!</p>

<p>What had been enough to give me comfort
yesterday became starvation to-day. Always the
cost of living leaping over the rise in wages.
Never free from poverty—even in America.</p>

<p>And then I clenched my hands and swore
that I would hold my dream of America—and
fight for it. I refuse to accept the America
where men make other men poor—create poverty
where God has poured out wealth. I refuse to
accept the America that gives the landlord the
right to keep on raising my rent and to drive me
to the streets when I do not earn enough to meet
his rapacious demands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>I cry out in this wilderness for America—my
America—different from all other countries. In
this America promised to the oppressed of all
lands, there is enough so that man need not
fight man for his bread, but work with man,
building the beauty that for hundreds of years,
in thousands of starved villages of Europe, men
have dreamed was America—beautiful homes—beautiful
cities—beautiful lives reaching up for
higher, ever higher visions of beauty.</p>

<p>I know you will say what right have I to
come here and make demands upon America.
But are not my demands the breath, the very
life of America? What, after all, is America,
but the response to the demands of immigrants
like me, seeking new worlds in which their spirits
may be free to create beauty? Were not the Pilgrim
Fathers immigrants demanding a new world
in which they could be free to live higher lives?</p>

<p>Yes, I make demands—not in arrogance, but
in all humility. I demand—driven by my desire
to give. I want to give not only that which I
am, but that which I might be if I only had the
chance. I want to give to America not the immigrant
you see before you—starved, stunted,
resentful, on the verge of hysteria from repression.
I want to give a new kind of immigrant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
full grown in mind and body—loving, serving,
upholding America.</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb">

<p>By writing out my protests and disillusions,
I aired and clarified them. Slowly, I began to
understand my unreasoning demands upon
America and what America had to offer. I saw
that America was a new world in the making,
that anyone who has something real in him can
find a way to contribute himself in this new world.
But I saw I had to fight for my chance to give
what I had to give, with the same life-and-death
earnestness with which a man fights for his bread.</p>

<p>What had I with my empty hands and my
hungry heart to give to America? I had my
hunger, my homelessness, my dumbness, my
blind searchings and gropings for what I knew
not. I had to give to America my aching
ignorance, my burning desire for knowledge.
I had to give to America the dirt and the ugliness
of my black life of poverty and my all-consuming
passion for beauty.</p>

<p>As long as I kept stretching out my hands
begging, begging for others to understand me,
for friendship, for help—as long as I kept
begging them to give me something—so long I
was shut out from America. But the moment I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
understood America well enough to tell her about
herself as I saw her—the moment I began to
express myself—America accepted my self-expression
as a gift from me, and from everywhere
hands reached out to help me.</p>

<p>With the money I earned writing out stories
of myself and my people, I was enabled to go
abroad and to take another look around the Old
World. I travelled from city to city. My special
purpose was to talk to the poor people in the different
countries and see how their chance to live
compared with the chances of those in America.</p>

<p>I find that in no other country has the new-comer
such a <i>direct</i> chance to come to the front
and become a partner in the making of the
country. Not where you come from, but what
is in you and what you are, counts in America.</p>

<p>In no other country is there such healthy
rebellion, such vital discontent, as there is among
the poor in America. And the rebellion and
discontent of the poor is in proportion to how
well off they are. The poor people demand
more of America than they ever dared to demand
of their homeland, because America is brimming
over with riches enough for everybody.</p>

<p>Life in America is a swift, sharp adventure.
In the old countries things are more or less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
settled. In America the soil is young, and the
people are young blossoming shoots of a new-grown
civilization.</p>

<p>The writers of Europe can only be stylists,
because life and traditions are fixed with them.
In America life is yet unexplored, and lived new
by each new-comer. And that is why America
is such virgin stuff for the novelist.</p>

<p>Fiction is a mirror of life as it is being lived
at the moment. And the moments are more
static in Europe than in America. I admit that
art is not so good in America as in Europe,
because art is a decoration, and America is a
young country too turbulent with life to take time
to decorate itself.</p>

<p>I who used to be the most violent rebel of
an immigrant, I now find myself the most ardent
defender of America. I see every flaw of
America perhaps more clearly than ever before.
I know the ruthless commercialism of our big
cities, the grabbing greed of landlords since the
war making the thought of home almost impossible
to the poor. I know that the gospel of
success which rules in America hurts itself,
because failure and defeat have revelations for
humanity’s deeper growth, to which success is
deaf and dumb and blind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>I know how often the artists, the makers of
beauty, in America are driven to the wall by the
merciless extortion of those who sell the means
of existence. But I know, too, that those of the
artists who survive are vitalized by the killing
things which had failed to kill them. America
has no place for the dawdling, soft-spined, make-believe
artists that swarm in the Paris cafés.</p>

<p>In the sunshine of the opportunities that have
come to me, I am always aware of those around
me and behind me who lacked the terrific vitality,
the brutal self-absorption with which I had to
fight for my chance or be blotted out. My eyes
will always turn back with loneliness and longing
for the old faces and old scenes that I loved
more than my life. But though it tears my heart
out of my body to go on, I must go on.</p>

<p>There’s no going back to the Old World for
anyone who has breathed the invigorating air of
America. I return to America with the new
realization that in no other country would a
nobody from nowhere—one of the millions of
lonely immigrants that pour through Ellis Island—a
dumb thing with nothing but hunger and
desire, get the chance to become articulate that
America has given me.</p>

<h3>§ 1</h3>

<p>“Oh, mother, can’t you use a fork?” exclaimed
Rachel as Mrs. Ravinsky took
the shell of the baked potato in her fingers and
raised it to her watering mouth.</p>

<p>“Here, <i>teacherin</i> mine, you want to learn
me in my old age how to put the bite in my
mouth?” The mother dropped the potato back
into her plate, too wounded to eat. Wiping her
hands on her blue-checked apron, she turned
her glance to her husband, at the opposite side
of the table.</p>

<p>“Yankev,” she said bitterly, “stick your
bone on a fork. Our <i>teacherin</i> said you dassn’t
touch no eatings with the hands.”</p>

<p>“All my teachers died already in the old
country,” retorted the old man. “I ain’t going
to learn nothing new no more from my American
daughter.” He continued to suck the marrow
out of the bone with that noisy relish that was
so exasperating to Rachel.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” stormed the girl, jumping up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
from the table in disgust; “I’ll never be able
to stand it here with you people.”</p>

<p>“‘You people’? What do you mean by
‘you people’?” shouted the old man, lashed
into fury by his daughter’s words. “You think
you got a different skin from us because you
went to college?”</p>

<p>“It drives me wild to hear you crunching
bones like savages. If you people won’t change,
I shall have to move and live by myself.”</p>

<p>Yankev Ravinsky threw the half-gnawed
bone upon the table with such vehemence that
a plate broke into fragments.</p>

<p>“You witch you!” he cried in a hoarse voice
tense with rage. “Move by yourself! We lived
without you while you was away in college, and
we can get on without you further. God ain’t
going to turn his nose on us because we ain’t
got table manners from America. A hell she
made from this house since she got home.”</p>

<p>“<i>Shah!</i> Yankev <i>leben</i>,” pleaded the mother,
“the neighbours are opening the windows to
listen to our hollering. Let us have a little quiet
for a while till the eating is over.”</p>

<p>But the accumulated hurts and insults that
the old man had borne in the one week since his
daughter’s return from college had reached the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
breaking-point. His face was convulsed, his
eyes flashed, and his lips were flecked with froth
as he burst out in a volley of scorn:</p>

<p>“You think you can put our necks in a chain
and learn us new tricks? You think you can
make us over for Americans? We got through
till fifty years of our lives eating in our own old
way——”</p>

<p>“Woe is me, Yankev <i>leben</i>!” entreated his
wife. “Why can’t we choke ourselves with our
troubles? Why must the whole world know how
we are tearing ourselves by the heads? In all
Essex Street, in all New York, there ain’t such
fights like by us.”</p>

<p>Her pleadings were in vain. There was no
stopping Yankev Ravinsky once his wrath was
roused. His daughter’s insistence upon the use
of a knife and fork spelled apostasy, anti-Semitism,
and the aping of the gentiles.</p>

<p>Like a prophet of old condemning unrighteousness,
he ran the gamut of denunciation, rising
to heights of fury that were sublime and godlike,
and sinking from sheer exhaustion to abusive
bitterness.</p>

<p>“<i>Pfui</i> on all your American colleges! <i>Pfui</i>
on the morals of America! No respect for old
age. No fear for God. Stepping with your feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
on all the laws of the holy Torah. A fire should
burn out the whole new generation. They
should sink into the earth, like Korah.”</p>

<p>“Look at him cursing and burning! Just because
I insist on their changing their terrible table
manners. One would think I was killing them.”</p>

<p>“Do you got to use a gun to kill?” cried
the old man, little red threads darting out of the
whites of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Who is doing the killing? Aren’t you
choking the life out of me? Aren’t you dragging
me by the hair to the darkness of past ages every
minute of the day? I’d die of shame if one of
my college friends should open the door while
you people are eating.”</p>

<p>“You—you——”</p>

<p>The old man was on the point of striking his
daughter when his wife seized the hand he raised.</p>

<p>“<i>Mincha!</i> Yankev, you forgot <i>Mincha</i>!”</p>

<p>This reminder was a flash of inspiration on
Mrs. Ravinsky’s part, the only thing that could
have ended the quarrelling instantly. <i>Mincha</i>
was the prayer just before sunset of the orthodox
Jews. This religious rite was so automatic with
the old man that at his wife’s mention of <i>Mincha</i>
everything was immediately shut out, and Yankev
Ravinsky rushed off to a corner of the room to pray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Ashrai Yoishwai Waisahuh!</i></p>

<p>“Happy are they who dwell in Thy house.
Ever shall I praise Thee. <i>Selah!</i> Great is
the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised; and
His greatness is unsearchable. On the majesty
and glory of Thy splendour, and on Thy marvellous
deeds, will I meditate.”</p>

<p>The shelter from the storms of life that the
artist finds in his art, Yankev Ravinsky found
in his prescribed communion with God. All the
despair caused by his daughter’s apostasy, the
insults and disappointments he suffered, were in
his sobbing voice. But as he entered into the
spirit of his prayer, he felt the man of flesh drop
away in the outflow of God around him. His
voice mellowed, the rigid wrinkles of his face
softened, the hard glitter of anger and condemnation
in his eyes was transmuted into the
light of love as he went on:</p>

<p>“The Lord is gracious and merciful; slow
to anger and of great loving-kindness. To all
that call upon Him in truth He will hear their
cry and save them.”</p>

<p>Oblivious to the passing and repassing of his
wife as she warmed anew the unfinished dinner,
he continued:</p>

<p>“Put not your trust in princes, in the son of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
man in whom there is no help.” Here Reb
Ravinsky paused long enough to make a silent
confession for the sin of having placed his hope
on his daughter instead of on God. His whole
body bowed with the sense of guilt. Then in a
moment his humility was transfigured into exaltation.
Sorrow for sin dissolved in joy as he
became more deeply aware of God’s unfailing
protection.</p>

<p>“Happy is he who hath the God of Jacob
for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God.
He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up
their wounds.”</p>

<p>A healing balm filled his soul as he returned
to the table, where the steaming hot food
awaited him. Rachel sat near the window pretending
to read a book. Her mother did not
urge her to join them at the table, fearing
another outbreak, and the meal continued in
silence.</p>

<p>The girl’s thoughts surged hotly as she
glanced from her father to her mother. A
chasm of four centuries could not have
separated her more completely from them than
her four years at Cornell.</p>

<p>“To think that I was born of these creatures!
It’s an insult to my soul. What kinship have I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
with these two lumps of ignorance and superstition?
They’re ugly and gross and stupid. I’m
all sensitive nerves. They want to wallow in
dirt.”</p>

<p>She closed her eyes to shut out the sight of
her parents as they silently ate together, unmindful
of the dirt and confusion.</p>

<p>“How is it possible that I lived with them
and like them only four years ago? What is it
in me that so quickly gets accustomed to the
best? Beauty and cleanliness are as natural to
me as if I’d been born on Fifth Avenue instead
of in the dirt of Essex Street.”</p>

<p>A vision of Frank Baker passed before her.
Her last long talk with him out under the trees
in college still lingered in her heart. She felt
that she had only to be with him again to carry
forward the beautiful friendship that had sprung
up between them. He had promised to come
shortly to New York. How could she possibly
introduce such a born and bred American to her
low, ignorant, dirty parents?</p>

<p>“I might as well tear the thought of Frank
Baker out of my heart,” she told herself. “If
he just once sees the pigsty of a home I come
from, if he just sees the table manners of my
father and mother, he’ll fly through the ceiling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>Timidly, Mrs. Ravinsky turned to her
daughter.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you going to give a taste the
eating?”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“I fried the <i>lotkes</i> special for you——”</p>

<p>“I can’t stand your fried, greasy stuff.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t even my cooking good no more
neither?” Her gnarled, hard-worked hands
clutched at her breast. “God from the world,
for what do I need yet any more my life?
Nothing I do for my child is no use no more.”</p>

<p>Her head sank; her whole body seemed to
shrivel and grow old with the sense of her own
futility.</p>

<p>“How I was hurrying to run by the butcher
before everybody else, so as to pick out the
grandest, fattest piece of <i>brust</i>!” she wailed,
tears streaming down her face. “And I put my
hand away from my heart and put a whole fresh
egg into the <i>lotkes</i>, and I stuffed the stove full
of coal like a millionaire so as to get the <i>lotkes</i>
fried so nice and brown; and now you give a
kick on everything I done——”</p>

<p>“Fool woman,” shouted her husband, “stop
laying yourself on the ground for your daughter
to step on you! What more can you expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
from a child raised up in America? What more
can you expect but that she should spit in your
face and make dirt from you?” His eyes, hot
and dry under their lids, flashed from his wife to
his daughter. “The old Jewish eating is poison
to her; she must have <i>treifah</i> ham—only forbidden
food.”</p>

<p>Bitter laughter shook him.</p>

<p>“Woman, how you patted yourself with pride
before all the neighbours, boasting of our great
American daughter coming home from college!
This is our daughter, our pride, our hope, our
pillow for our old age that we were dreaming
about. This is our American <i>teacherin</i>! A Jew-hater,
an anti-Semite we brought into the world,
a betrayer of our race who hates her own father
and mother like the Russian Tsar once hated a
Jew. She makes herself so refined, she can’t
stand it when we use the knife or fork the wrong
way; but her heart is that of a brutal Cossack,
and she spills her own father’s and mother’s
blood like water.”</p>

<p>Every word he uttered seared Rachel’s soul
like burning acid. She felt herself becoming a
witch, a she-devil, under the spell of his accusations.</p>

<p>“You want me to love you yet?” She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
turned upon her father like an avenging fury.
“If there’s any evil hatred in my soul, you have
roused it with your cursed preaching.”</p>

<p>“<i>Oi-i-i!</i> Highest One! pity Yourself on
us!” Mrs. Ravinsky wrung her hands.
“Rachel, Yankev, let there be an end to this
knife-stabbing! <i>Gottuniu!</i> my flesh is torn to
pieces!”</p>

<p>Unheeding her mother’s pleading, Rachel
rushed to the closet where she kept her things.</p>

<p>“I was a crazy idiot to think that I could
live with you people under one roof.” She
flung on her hat and coat and bolted for the
door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ravinsky seized Rachel’s arm in
passionate entreaty.</p>

<p>“My child, my heart, my life, what do you
mean? Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I mean to get out of this hell of a home
this very minute,” she said, tearing loose from
her mother’s clutching hands.</p>

<p>“Woe is me! My child! We’ll be to
shame and to laughter by the whole world.
What will people say?”</p>

<p>“Let them say! My life is my own; I’ll
live as I please.” She slammed the door in her
mother’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“They want me to love them yet,” ran the
mad thoughts in Rachel’s brain as she hurried
through the streets, not knowing where she was
going, not caring. “Vampires, bloodsuckers
fastened on my flesh! Black shadow blighting
every ray of light that ever came my way!
Other parents scheme and plan and wear themselves
out to give their child a chance, but they
put dead stones in front of every chance I made
for myself.”</p>

<p>With the cruelty of youth to everything not
youth, Rachel reasoned:</p>

<p>“They have no rights, no claims over me,
like other parents who do things for their children.
It was my own brains, my own courage,
my own iron will that forced my way out of the
sweatshop to my present position in the public
schools. I owe them nothing, nothing, nothing.”</p>


<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p>Two weeks already away from home, Rachel
looked about her room. It was spotlessly clean.
She had often said to herself while at home with
her parents: “All I want is an empty room, with
a bed and table and chair. As long as it is
clean and away from them, I’ll be happy.”</p>

<p>But was she happy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>A distant door closed, followed by the retreating
sound of descending footsteps. Then
all was still, the stifling stillness of a lodging-house.
The white, empty walls pressed in upon
her, suffocated her. She listened acutely for
any stir of life, but the continued silence was
unbroken save for the insistent ticking of her
watch.</p>

<p>“I ran away from home burning for life,”
she mused, “and all I’ve found is the loneliness
that’s death.” A wave of self-pity weakened
her almost to the point of tears. “I’m alone!
I’m alone!” she moaned, crumpling into a heap.</p>

<p>“Must it always be with me like this,” her
soul cried in terror, “either to live among those
who drag me down or in the awful isolation of
a hall bed-room? Oh, I’ll die of loneliness
among these frozen, each-shut-in-himself Americans!
It’s one thing to break away, but, oh, the
strength to go on alone! How can I ever do
it? The love instinct is so strong in me; I
cannot live without love, without people.”</p>

<p>The thought of a letter from Frank Baker
suddenly lightened her spirits. That very evening
she was to meet him for dinner. Here was
hope, more than hope. Just seeing him again
would surely bring the certainty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>This new rush of light upon her dark horizon
so softened her heart that she could almost
tolerate her superfluous parents.</p>

<p>“If I could only have love and my own life,
I could almost forgive them for bringing me into
the world. I don’t really hate them; I only hate
them when they stand between me and the new
America that I’m to conquer.”</p>

<p>Answering her impulse, her feet led her to
the familiar Ghetto streets. On the corner of
the block where her parents lived she paused,
torn between the desire to see her people and
the fear of their nagging reproaches. The old
Jewish proverb came to her mind: “The wolf
is not afraid of the dog, but he hates his bark.”
“I’m not afraid of their black curses for sin.
It’s nothing to me if they accuse me of being
an anti-Semite or a murderer, and yet why does
it hurt me so?”</p>

<p>Rachel had prepared herself to face the usual
hail-storm of reproaches and accusations, but as
she entered the dark hallway of the tenement,
she heard her father’s voice chanting the old
familiar Hebrew psalm of “The Race of
Sorrows”:</p>

<p>“Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry
come unto Thee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“For my days are consumed like smoke, and
my bones are burned as an hearth.</p>

<p>“I am like a pelican of the wilderness.</p>

<p>“I am like an owl of the desert.</p>

<p>“I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled
my drink with weeping.”</p>

<p>A faintness came over her. The sobbing
strains of the lyric song melted into her veins
like a magic sap, making her warm and human
again. All her strength seethed to flow out of
her in pity for her people. She longed to throw
herself on the dirty, ill-smelling tenement stairs
and weep: “Nothing is real but love—love.
Nothing so false as ambition.”</p>

<p>Since her early childhood she remembered
often waking up in the middle of the night and
hearing her father chant this age-old song of
woe. There flashed before her a vivid picture
of him, huddled in the corner beside the table
piled high with Hebrew books, swaying to the
rhythm of his jeremiad, the sputtering light of
the candle stuck in a bottle throwing uncanny
shadows over his gaunt face. The skull-cap,
the side-locks, and the long grey beard made
him seem like some mystic stranger from a far-off
world and not a father. The father of the
daylight who ate with a knife, spat on the floor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
and who was forever denouncing America and
Americans was different from this stranger of
the mystic spirit who could thrill with such
impassioned rapture.</p>

<p>Thousands of years of exile, thousands of
years of hunger, loneliness, and want swept over
her as she listened to her father’s voice. Something
seemed to be crying out to her to run in
and seize her father and mother in her arms and
hold them close.</p>

<p>“Love, love—nothing is true between us but
love,” she thought.</p>

<p>But why couldn’t she do what she longed
to do? Why, with all her passionate sympathy
for them, should any actual contact with
her people seem so impossible? No, she
couldn’t go in just yet. Instead, she ran up
on the roof, where she could be alone. She
stationed herself at the air-shaft opposite their
kitchen window, where for the first time since
she had left in a rage she could see her old
home.</p>

<p><i>Ach!</i> what sickening disorder! In the sink
were the dirty dishes stacked high, untouched,
it looked, for days. The table still held the
remains of the last meal. Clothes were strewn
about the chairs. The bureau-drawers were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
open, and their contents brimmed over in mad
confusion.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t endure it, this terrible dirt!”
Her nails dug into her palms, shaking with the
futility of her visit. “It would be worse than
death to go back to them. It would mean
giving up order, cleanliness, sanity, everything
that I’ve striven all these years to attain. It
would mean giving up the hope of my new world—the
hope of Frank Baker.”</p>

<p>The sound of the creaking door reached her
where she crouched against the air-shaft. She
looked again into the murky depths of the room.
Her mother had entered. With arms full of
paper bags of provisions, the old woman paused
on the threshold, her eyes dwelling on the dim
figure of her husband. A look of pathetic
tenderness illumined her wrinkled features.</p>

<p>“I’ll make something good to eat for you,
yes?”</p>

<p>Reb Ravinsky only dropped his head on his
breast. His eyes were red and dry, sandy with
sorrow that could find no release in tears. Good
God! never had Rachel seen such profound
despair. For the first time she noticed the
grooved tracings of withering age knotted on his
face and the growing hump on her mother’s back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“Already the shadow of death hangs over
them,” she thought as she watched them.
“They’re already with one foot in the grave.
Why can’t I be human to them before they’re
dead? Why can’t I?”</p>

<p>Rachel blotted away the picture of the sordid
room with both hands over her eyes.</p>

<p>“To death with my soul! I wish I were a
plain human being with a heart instead of a
monster of selfishness with a soul.”</p>

<p>But the pity she felt for her parents began
now to be swept away in a wave of pity for
herself.</p>

<p>“How every step in advance costs me my
heart’s blood! My greatest tragedy in life is
that I always see the two opposite sides at the
same time. What seems to me right one day
seems all wrong the next. Not only that, but
many things seem right and wrong at the same
time. I feel I have a right to my own life, and
yet I feel just as strongly that I owe my father
and mother something. Even if I don’t love
them, I have no right to step over them. I’m
drawn to them by something more compelling
than love. It is the cry of their dumb, wasted
lives.”</p>

<p>Again Rachel looked into the dimly lighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
room below. Her mother placed food upon the
table. With a self-effacing stoop of humility,
she entreated, “Eat only while it is hot yet.”</p>

<p>With his eyes fixed almost unknowingly, Reb
Ravinsky sat down. Her mother took the chair
opposite him, but she only pretended to eat the
slender portion of the food she had given
herself.</p>

<p>Rachel’s heart swelled. Yes, it had always
been like that. Her mother had taken the
smallest portion of everything for herself. Complaints,
reproaches, upbraidings, abuse, yes, all
these had been heaped by her upon her mother;
but always the juiciest piece of meat was placed
on her plate, the thickest slice of bread; the
warmest covering was given to her, while her
mother shivered through the night.</p>

<p>“Ah, I don’t want to abandon them!” she
thought; “I only want to get to the place where
I belong. I only want to get to the mountain-tops
and view the world from the heights, and
then I’ll give them everything I’ve achieved.”</p>

<p>Her thoughts were sharply broken in upon
by the loud sound of her father’s eating. Bent
over the table, he chewed with noisy gulps a
piece of herring, his temples working to the
motion of his jaws. With each audible swallow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
and smacking of the lips, Rachel’s heart tightened
with loathing.</p>

<p>“Their dirty ways turn all my pity into
hate.” She felt her toes and her fingers curl
inward with disgust. “I’ll never amount to
anything if I’m not strong enough to break away
from them once and for all.” Hypnotizing
herself into her line of self-defence, her
thoughts raced on: “I’m only cruel to be kind.
If I went back to them now, it would not be
out of love, but because of weakness—because
of doubt and unfaith in myself.”</p>

<p>Rachel bluntly turned her back. Her head
lifted. There was iron will in her jaws.</p>

<p>“If I haven’t the strength to tear free from
the old, I can never conquer the new. Every
new step a man makes is a tearing away from
those clinging to him. I must get tight and
hard as rock inside of me if I’m ever to do the
things I set out to do. I must learn to suffer
and suffer, walk through blood and fire, and not
bend from my course.”</p>

<p>For the last time she looked at her parents.
The terrible loneliness of their abandoned old
age, their sorrowful eyes, the wrung-dry weariness
on their faces, the whole black picture of
her ruined, desolate home, burned into her flesh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
She knew all the pain of one unjustly condemned,
and the guilt of one with the spilt
blood of helpless lives upon his hands. Then
came tears, blinding, wrenching tears that tore
at her heart until it seemed that they would rend
her body into shreds.</p>

<p>“God! God!” she sobbed as she turned
her head away from them, “if all this suffering
were at least for something worth while, for
something outside myself! But to have to break
them and crush them merely because I have a
fastidious soul that can’t stomach their table
manners, merely because I can’t strangle my
aching ambitions to rise in the world!”</p>

<p>She could no longer sustain the conflict which
raged within her higher and higher at every
moment. With a sudden tension of all her
nerves she pulled herself together and stumbled
blindly down the stairs and out of the house.
And she felt as if she had torn away from the
flesh and blood of her own body.</p>


<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p>Out in the street she struggled to get hold
of herself again. Despite the tumult and upheaval
that racked her soul, an intoxicating lure
still held her up—the hope of seeing Frank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Baker that evening. She was indeed a storm-racked
ship, but within sight of shore. She need
but throw out the signal, and help was nigh.
She need but confide to Frank Baker of her
break with her people, and all the dormant sympathy
between them would surge up. His
understanding would widen and deepen because
of her great need for his understanding. He
would love her the more because of her great
need for his love.</p>

<p>Forcing back her tears, stepping over her
heartbreak, she hurried to the hotel where she
was to meet him. Her father’s impassioned
rapture when he chanted the psalms of David
lit up the visionary face of the young Jewess.</p>

<p>“After all, love is the beginning of the real
life,” she thought as Frank Baker’s dark, handsome
face flashed before her. “With him to
hold on to, I’ll begin my new world.”</p>

<p>Borne higher and higher by the intoxicating
illusion of her great destiny, she cried:</p>

<p>“A person all alone is but a futile cry in an
unheeding wilderness. One alone is but a
shadow, an echo of reality. It takes two together
to create reality. Two together can pioneer a
new world.”</p>

<p>With a vision of herself and Frank Baker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
marching side by side to the conquest of her
heart’s desire, she added:</p>

<p>“No wonder a man’s love means so little to
the American woman. They belong to the
world in which they are born. They belong to
their fathers and mothers; they belong to their
relatives and friends. They are human even
without a man’s love. I don’t belong; I’m not
human. Only a man’s love can save me and
make me human again.”</p>

<p>It was the busy dinner-hour at the fashionable
restaurant. Pausing at the doorway with searching
eyes and lips eagerly parted, Rachel’s swift
glance circled the lobby. Those seated in the
dining-room beyond who were not too absorbed
in one another, noticed a slim, vivid figure of
ardent youth, but with dark, age-old eyes that
told of the restless seeking of her homeless race.</p>

<p>With nervous little movements of anxiety,
Rachel sat down, got up, then started across the
lobby. Half-way, she stopped, and her breath
caught.</p>

<p>“Mr. Baker,” she murmured, her hands
fluttering toward him with famished eagerness.
His smooth, athletic figure had a cocksureness
that to the girl’s worshipping gaze seemed the
perfection of male strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“You must be doing wonderful things,” came
from her admiringly, “you look so happy, so
shining with life.”</p>

<p>“Yes”—he shook her hand vigorously—“I’ve
been living for the first time since I was
a kid. I’m full of such interesting experiences.
I’m actually working in an East Side settlement.”</p>

<p>Dazed by his glamorous success, Rachel
stammered soft phrases of congratulation as he
led her to a table. But seated opposite him,
the face of this untried youth, flushed with the
health and happiness of another world than that
of the poverty-crushed Ghetto, struck her almost
as an insincerity.</p>

<p>“You in an East Side settlement?” she
interrupted sharply. “What reality can there
be in that work for you?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he cried, his shoulders squaring with
the assurance of his master’s degree in sociology,
“it’s great to get under the surface and see how
the other half live. It’s so picturesque! My
conception of these people has greatly changed
since I’ve been visiting their homes.” He
launched into a glowing account of the East
Side as seen by a twenty-five-year-old college
graduate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“I thought them mostly immersed in hard
labour, digging subways or slaving in sweatshops,” he went on.
“But think of the poetry which the immigrant is daily living!”</p>

<p>“But they’re so sunk in the dirt of poverty,
what poetry do you see there?”</p>

<p>“It’s their beautiful home life, the poetic
devotion between parents and children, the
sacrifices they make for one another——”</p>

<p>“Beautiful home life? Sacrifices? Why,
all I know of is the battle to the knife between
parents and children. It’s black tragedy that
boils there, not the pretty sentiments that you
imagine.”</p>

<p>“My dear child”—he waved aside her objection—“you’re
too close to judge dispassionately.
This very afternoon, on one of my friendly visits,
I came upon a dear old man who peered up at
me through horn-rimmed glasses behind his pile
of Hebrew books. He was hardly able to speak
English, but I found him a great scholar.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a lazy old do-nothing, a bloodsucker
on his wife and children.”</p>

<p>Too shocked for remonstrance, Frank Baker
stared at her.</p>

<p>“How else could he have time in the middle
of the afternoon to pore over his books?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Rachel’s voice was hard with bitterness. “Did
you see his wife? I’ll bet she was slaving for
him in the kitchen. And his children slaving
for him in the sweatshop.”</p>

<p>“Even so, think of the fine devotion that the
women and children show in making the lives of
your Hebrew scholars possible. It’s a fine contribution
to America, where our tendency is to
forget idealism.”</p>

<p>“Give me better a plain American man who
supports his wife and children, and I’ll give you
all those dreamers of the Talmud.”</p>

<p>He smiled tolerantly at her vehemence.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” he insisted, “I’ve found
wonderful material for my new book in all this.
I think I’ve got a new angle on the social types
of your East Side.”</p>

<p>An icy band tightened about her heart.
“Social types,” her lips formed. How could
she possibly confide to this man of the terrible
tragedy that she had been through that very
day? Instead of the understanding and sympathy
that she had hoped to find, there were
only smooth platitudes, the sight-seer’s surface
interest in curious “social types.”</p>

<p>Frank Baker talked on. Rachel seemed to
be listening, but her eyes had a far-off, abstracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
look. She was quiet as a spinning-top is quiet,
her thoughts and emotions revolving within her
at high speed.</p>

<p>“That man in love with me? Why, he
doesn’t see me or feel me. I don’t exist to him.
He’s only stuck on himself, blowing his own
horn. Will he never stop with his ‘I,’ ‘I,’ ‘I’?
Why, I was a crazy lunatic to think that just
because we took the same courses in college he
would understand me out in the real world.”</p>

<p>All the fire suddenly went out of her eyes.
She looked a thousand years old as she sank
back wearily in her chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’m boring you with all my heavy
talk on sociology.” Frank Baker’s words seemed
to come to her from afar. “I have tickets for
a fine musical comedy that will cheer you up,
Miss Ravinsky——”</p>

<p>“Thanks, thanks,” she cut in hurriedly.
Spend a whole evening sitting beside him in a
theatre when her heart was breaking? No. All
she wanted was to get away—away where she
could be alone. “I have work to do,” she heard
herself say. “I’ve got to get home.”</p>

<p>Frank Baker murmured words of polite disappointment
and escorted her back to her door.
She watched the sure swing of his athletic figure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
as he strode away down the street, then she
rushed upstairs.</p>

<p>Back in her little room, stunned, bewildered,
blinded with her disillusion, she sat staring at
her four empty walls.</p>

<p>Hours passed, but she made no move, she
uttered no sound. Doubled fists thrust between
her knees, she sat there, staring blindly at her
empty walls.</p>

<p>“I can’t live with the old world, and I’m yet
too green for the new. I don’t belong to those
who gave me birth or to those with whom I was
educated.”</p>

<p>Was this to be the end of all her struggles
to rise in America, she asked herself, this crushing
daze of loneliness? Her driving thirst for
an education, her desperate battle for a little
cleanliness, for a breath of beauty, the tearing
away from her own flesh and blood to free
herself from the yoke of her parents—what was
it all worth now? Where did it lead to? Was
loneliness to be the fruit of it all?</p>

<p>Night was melting away like a fog; through
the open window the first lights of dawn were
appearing. Rachel felt the sudden touch of the
sun upon her face, which was bathed in tears.
Overcome by her sorrow, she shuddered and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
put her hand over her eyes as though to shut
out the unwelcome contact. But the light shone
through her fingers.</p>

<p>Despite her weariness, the renewing breath
of the fresh morning entered her heart like a
sunbeam. A mad longing for life filled her
veins.</p>

<p>“I want to live,” her youth cried. “I want
to live, even at the worst.”</p>

<p>Live how? Live for what? She did not
know. She only felt she must struggle against
her loneliness and weariness as she had once
struggled against dirt, against the squalor and
ugliness of her Ghetto home.</p>

<p>Turning from the window, she concentrated
her mind, her poor tired mind, on one idea.</p>

<p>“I have broken away from the old world;
I’m through with it. It’s already behind me.
I must face this loneliness till I get to the new
world. Frank Baker can’t help me; I must
hope for no help from the outside. I’m alone;
I’m alone till I get there.</p>

<p>“But am I really alone in my seeking?
I’m one of the millions of immigrant children,
children of loneliness, wandering between worlds
that are at once too old and too new to live in.”</p>

</div>


<p>I had just begun to unpack and arrange my
things in my new quarters when Hanneh
Breineh edged herself confidingly into my room
and started to tell me the next chapter in the
history of all her lodgers.</p>

<p>“And this last one what sleeps in the
kitchen,” she finished, “he’s such a stingy—Moisheh
the Schnorrer they call him. He washes
himself his own shirts and sews together the
holes from his socks to save a penny. Think
only! He cooks himself his own meat once a
week for the Sabbath and the rest of the time
it’s cabbage and potatoes or bread and herring.
And the herring what he buys are the squashed
and smashed ones from the bottom of the barrel.
And the bread he gets is so old and hard he’s
got to break it with a hammer. For why should
such a stingy grouch live in this world if he
don’t allow himself the bite in the mouth?”</p>

<p>It was no surprise to me that Hanneh Breineh
knew all this, for everybody in her household
cooked and washed in the same kitchen, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
everybody knew what everybody else ate and
what everybody else wore down to the number
of patches on their underwear.</p>

<p>“And by what do you work for a living?”
she asked, as she settled herself on my cot.</p>

<p>“I study at college by day and I give English
lessons and write letters for the people in
the evening.”</p>

<p>“Ach! So you are learning for a <i>teacherin</i>?”
She rose, and looked at me up and down and
down and up, her red-lidded eyes big with awe.
“So that’s why you wanted so particular a room
to yourself? Nobody in my house has a room
by herself alone just like you. They all got to
squeeze themselves together to make it come out
cheaper.”</p>

<p>By the evening everybody in that house knew
I was a <i>teacherin</i>, and Moisheh the Schnorrer was
among my first applicants for instruction.</p>

<p>“How much will you charge me for learning
me English, a lesson?” he blurted, abrupt
because of his painful bashfulness.</p>

<p>I looked up at the tall, ungainly creature
with round, stooping shoulders, and massive,
shaggy head—physically a veritable giant, yet
so timid, so diffident, afraid almost of his own
shadow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“I wanna learn how to sign myself my
name,” he went on. “Only—you’ll make it
for me a little cheaper—yes?”</p>

<p>“Fifty cents an hour,” I answered, drawn
by the dumb, hunted look that cried to me out
of his eyes.</p>

<p>Moisheh scratched his shaggy head and bit
the nails of his huge, toil-worn hand. “Maybe—could
you yet—perhaps—make it a little
cheaper?” he fumbled.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you working?”</p>

<p>His furrowed face coloured with confusion.
“Yes—but—but my family. I got to save myself
together a penny to a penny for them.”</p>

<p>“Oh! So you’re already married?”</p>

<p>“No—not married. My family in Russia—<i>mein</i>
old mother and Feivel, <i>mein</i> doctor brother,
and Berel the baby, he was already learning for
a book-keeper before the war.”</p>

<p>The coarse peasant features were transformed
with tenderness as he started to tell me the story
of his loved ones in Russia.</p>

<p>“Seven years ago I came to America. I
thought only to make quick money to send the
ship tickets for them all, but I fell into the hands
of a cockroach boss.</p>

<p>“You know a cockroach boss is a <i>landsman</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
that comes to meet the greenhorns by the ship.
He made out he wanted to help me, but he only
wanted to sweat me into my grave. Then came
the war and I began to earn big wages; but they
were driven away from their village and my
money didn’t get to them at all. And for more
than a year I didn’t know if my people were yet
alive in the world.”</p>

<p>He took a much-fingered, greasy envelope
from his pocket. “That’s the first letter I got
from them in months. The book-keeper boarder
read it for me already till he’s sick from it.
Only read it for me over again,” he begged as
he handed it to me upside down.</p>

<p>The letter was from Smirsk, Poland, where
the two brothers and their old mother had fled
for refuge. It was the cry of despair—food—clothes—shoes—the
cry of hunger and nakedness.
His eyes filled and unheeding tears fell
on his rough, trembling hands as I read.</p>

<p>“That I should have bread three times a day
and them starving!” he gulped. “By each
bite it chokes me. And when I put myself on
my warm coat, it shivers in me when I think how
they’re without a shirt on their backs. I already
sent them a big package of things, but until I
hear from them I’m like without air in my lungs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>I wondered how, in their great need and in
his great anxiety to supply it, he could think of
English lessons or spare the little money to pay
for his tuition.</p>

<p>He divined my thoughts. “Already seven
years I’m here and I didn’t take for myself the
time to go night school,” he explained. “Now
they’ll come soon and I don’t want them to shame
themselves from their <i>Amerikaner</i> brother what
can’t sign his own name, and they in Russia
write me such smart letters in English.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you go to school like your
brothers?”</p>

<p>“Me—school?” He shrugged his toil-stooped
shoulders. “I was the only breadgiver
after my father he died. And with my nose in
the earth on a farm how could I take myself
the time to learn?”</p>

<p>His queer, bulging eyes with their yearning,
passionate look seemed to cling to something
beyond—out of reach. “But my brothers—<i>ach</i>!
my brothers! They’re so high-educated!
I worked the nails from off my fingers, but only
they should learn—they should become people
in the world.”</p>

<p>And he deluged me with questions as to the
rules of immigrant admission and how long it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
would take for him to learn to sign his name
so that he would be a competent leader when
his family would arrive.</p>

<p>“I ain’t so dumb like I look on my face.”
He nudged me confidentially. “I already
found out from myself which picture means
where the train goes. If it’s for Brooklyn
Bridge, then the hooks go this way”—he
clumsily drew in the air with his thick fingers—“and
if it’s for the South Ferry, then the
words twist the other way around.”</p>

<p>I marvelled at his frank revelation of himself.</p>

<p>“What is your work?” I asked, more and
more drawn by some hidden power of this simple
peasant.</p>

<p>“I’m a presser by pants.”</p>

<p>Now I understood the cause of the stooped,
rounded shoulders. It must have come from
pounding away with a heavy iron at an ironing
board, day after day, year after year. But for
all the ravages of poverty, of mean, soul-crushing
drudgery that marked this man, something
big and indomitable in him fascinated me. His
was the strength knitted and knotted from the
hardiest roots of the earth. Filled with awe, I
looked up at him. Here was a man submerged
in the darkness of illiteracy—of pinch and scraping and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
want—yet untouched—unspoiled, with
the same simplicity of spirit that was his as a
wide-eyed, dreamy youth in the green fields of
Russia.</p>

<p>We had our first lesson, and, though I needed
every cent I could earn, I felt like a thief taking
his precious pennies. But he would pay. “It’s
worth to me more than a quarter only to learn
how to hold up the pencil,” he exulted as he
gripped the pencil upright in his thick fist. All
the yearning, the intense desire for education
were in the big, bulging eyes that he raised
towards me. “No wonder I could never make
those little black hooks for words; I was always
grabbing my pencil like a fork for sticking up
meat.”</p>

<p>With what sublime absorption he studied me
as I showed him how to shape the letters for his
name! Eyes wide—mouth open—his huge,
stoop-shouldered body leaning forward—quivering
with hunger to grasp the secret turnings of
“the little black hooks” that signified his name.</p>

<p>“M-o-i-s-h-e-h,” he repeated after me as I
guided his pencil.</p>

<p>“Now do it alone,” I urged.</p>

<p>Moisheh rolled up his sleeve like one ready
for a fray. The sweat dripped from his face as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
he struggled for the muscular control of his
clumsy fingers.</p>

<p>Night after night he wrestled heroically with
the “little black hooks.” At last his efforts were
rewarded. He learned how to shape the letters
without any help.</p>

<p>“God from the world!” he cried with
childishly pathetic joy as he wrote his name for
the first time. “This is me—Moisheh!” He
lifted the paper and held it off and then held it
close, drunk with the wonder of the “little black
hooks.” They seemed so mysterious to him,
and his eyes loomed large—transfigured with the
miracle of seeing himself for the first time in
script.</p>

<p>It was the week after that he asked me to
write his letter, and this time it was from my
eyes that the unheeding tears dropped as I
wrote the words he dictated.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To my dear Loving Mother, and to my
worthy Honourable Brother Feivel, the Doctor,
and to my youngest brother, the joy from my
life, the light from mine eyes, Berel the Book-keeper!</p>

<p>“Long years and good luck to you all.
Thanks the highest One in Heaven that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
are alive. Don’t worry for nothing. So long
I have yet my two strong hands to work you
will yet live to have from everything plenty.
For all those starving days in Russia, you will
live to have joy in America.</p>

<p>“You, Feivel, will yet have a grand doctor’s
office, with an electric dentist sign over your
door, and a gold tooth to pull in the richest
customers. And you, Berel, my honourable
book-keeper, will yet live to wear a white
starched collar like all the higher-ups in
America. And you, my loving mother, will
yet shine up the block with the joy from your
children.</p>

<p>“I am sending you another box of things,
and so soon as I get from you the word, I’ll
send for you the ship tickets, even if it costs
the money from all the banks in America.</p>

<p>“Luck and blessings on your dear heads. I
am going around praying and counting the
minutes till you are all with me together in
America.”</p>
</div>

<p>Our lessons had gone on steadily for some
months and already he was able to write the
letters of the alphabet. One morning before I
was out of bed he knocked at my door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Quick only! A blue letter printed from
Russia!” he shouted in an excited voice.</p>

<p>Through the crack of the door he shoved in
the cablegram. “Send ship tickets or we die—pogrom,”
I read aloud.</p>

<p>“<i>Weh—weh!</i>” A cry of a dumb, wounded
animal broke from the panic-stricken Moisheh.</p>

<p>The cup of coffee that Hanneh Breineh
lifted to her lips dropped with a crash to the
floor. “Where pogrom?” she demanded,
rushing in.</p>

<p>I re-read the cablegram.</p>

<p>“Money for ship tickets!” stammered
Moisheh. He drew forth a sweaty moneybag
that lay hid beneath his torn grey shirt and with
trembling hands began counting the greasy bills.
“Only four hundred and thirty-three dollars!
Woe is me!” He cracked the knuckles of his
fingers in a paroxysm of grief. “It’s six
hundred I got to have!”</p>

<p>“<i>Gottuniu!</i> Listen to him only!” Hanneh
Breineh shook Moisheh roughly. “You’d think
he was living by wild Indians—not by people
with hearts....”</p>

<p>“Boarders!” she called. “Moisheh’s old
mother and his two brothers are in Smirsk where
there’s a pogrom.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>The word “pogrom” struck like a bombshell.
From the sink, the stove, they gathered, in
various stages of undress, around Moisheh,
electrified into one bond of suffering brotherhood.</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh, hand convulsively clutching
her breast, began an impassioned appeal.
“Which from us here needs me to tell what’s a
pogrom? It drips yet the blood from my heart
when I only begin to remember. Only nine
years old I was—the <i>pogromschiks</i> fell on our
village.... Frightened!... You all know
what’s to be frightened from death—frightened
from being burned alive or torn to pieces by
wild wolves—but what’s that compared to the
cold shiverings that shook us by the hands and
feet when we heard the drunken Cossacks coming
nearer and nearer our hut. The last second my
mother, like a crazy, pushed me and my little
sister into the chimney. We heard the house
tremble with shots—cries from my mother—father—then
stillness. In the middle of the
black night my little sister and I crawled ourselves
out to see——” Hanneh Breineh covered
her eyes as though to shut out the hideous vision.</p>

<p>Again Hanneh Breineh’s voice arose. “I
got no more breath for words—only this—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
last bite from our mouths, the last shirt from
our backs we got to take away to help out
Moisheh. It’s not only Moisheh’s old mother
that’s out there—it’s our own old mother—our
own flesh-and-blood brothers.... Even I—beggar
that I am—even I will give my only
feather bed to the pawn.”</p>

<p>A hush, and then a tumult of suppressed
emotion. The room seethed with wild longings
of the people to give—to help—to ease their
aching hearts sharing Moisheh’s sorrow.</p>

<p>Shoolem, a grey, tottering ragpicker, brought
forth a grimy cigar-box full of change. “Here
is all the pennies and nickels and dimes I was
saving and saving myself for fifteen years. I
was holding by life on one hope—the hope that
some day I would yet die before the holy walls
from Jerusalem.” With the gesture of a Rothschild
he waved it in the air as he handed it over.
“But here you got it, Moisheh. May it help to
bring your brothers in good luck to America!”</p>

<p>Sosheh, the finisher, turned aside as she dug
into her stocking and drew forth a crisp five-dollar
bill. “That all I got till my next pay.
Only it should help them,” she gulped. “I
wish I had somebody left alive that I could send
a ship ticket to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>Zaretsky, the matchmaker, snuffed noisily a
pinch of tobacco and pulled from his overcoat
pocket a book of War Savings stamps. “I got
fourteen dollars of American Liberty. Only let
them come in good luck and I’ll fix them out
yet with the two grandest girls in New York.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The ship bearing Moisheh’s family was to
dock the next morning at eleven o’clock. The
night before Hanneh Breineh and all of us were
busy decorating the house in honour of the
arrivals. The sound of hammering and sweeping
and raised, excited voices filled the air.</p>

<p>Sosheh, the finisher, standing on top of a
soap box, was garnishing the chandelier with
red-paper flowers.</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh tacked bright, checked
oilcloth on top of the washtubs.</p>

<p>Zaretsky was nailing together the broken leg
of the table.</p>

<p>“I should live so,” laughed Sosheh, her
sallow face flushed with holiday joy. “This
kitchen almost shines like a parlour, but for only
this——” pointing to the sagging lounge where
the stained mattress protruded.</p>

<p>“<i>Shah!</i> I’ll fix this up in a minute so it’ll look
like new from the store.” And Hanneh Breineh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
took out the red-flowered, Sabbath tablecloth
from the bureau and tucked it around the lounge.</p>

<p>Meantime Moisheh, his eyes popping with
excitement, raised clouds of dust as he swept
dirt that had been gathering since Passover from
the corners of the room.</p>

<p>Unable to wait any longer for the big
moment, he had been secretly planning for
weeks, zip! under the bed went the mountain
of dirt, to be followed by the broom, which he
kicked out of sight.</p>

<p>“Enough with the cleaning!” he commanded.
“Come only around,” and he pulled
out from the corner his Russian steamer basket.</p>

<p>“Oi—oi—oi—oi, and ai—ai!” the boarders
shouted, hilariously. “Will you treat us to a
holiday cake maybe?”</p>

<p>“Wait only!” He gesticulated grandly as
he loosened the lock.</p>

<p>One by one he held up and displayed the
treasured trousseau which little by little he had
gathered together for his loved ones.</p>

<p>A set of red-woollen underwear for each of
the brothers, and for his mother a thick, grey
shirt. Heavy cotton socks, a blue-checked
apron, and a red-velvet waist appeared next.
And then—Moisheh was reduced to guttural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
grunts of primitive joy as he unfolded a rainbow
tie for Feivel, the doctor, and pink suspenders
for his “baby” brother.</p>

<p>Moisheh did not remove his clothes—no sleep
for him that night. It was still dark when the
sound of his heavy shoes, clumping around the
kitchen as he cooked his breakfast, woke the rest
of us.</p>

<p>“You got to come with me—I can’t hold
myself together with so much joy,” he implored.
There was no evading his entreaties, so I
promised to get away as soon as I could and
meet him at the dock.</p>

<p>I arrived at Ellis Island to find Moisheh
stamping up and down like a wild horse. “What
are they holding them so long?” he cried, mad
with anxiety to reach those for whom he had so
long waited and hungered.</p>

<p>I had to shake him roughly before I could
make him aware of my presence, and immediately
he was again lost in his eager search of
the mob that crowded the gates.</p>

<p>The faces of the immigrants, from the tiniest
babe at its mother’s breast to the most decrepit
old grey-haired man, were all stamped with the
same transfigured look—a look of those who
gazed for the first time upon the radiance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
dawn. The bosoms of the women heaved with
excitement. The men seemed to be expanding,
growing with the surge of realized hopes, of
dreams come true. They inhaled deeply, eager
to fill their stifled bodies and souls with the first
life-giving breath of free air. Their eyes were
luminous with hope, bewildered joy and vague
forebodings. A voice was heard above the
shouted orders and shuffling feet—above the
clamour of the pressing crowds—“<i>Gott sei
dank!</i>” The pæan of thanksgiving was echoed
and re-echoed—a pæan of nations released—America.</p>

<p>I had to hold tight to the bars not to be
trampled underfoot by the crowd that surged
through the gates. Suddenly a wild animal cry
tore from Moisheh’s throat. “<i>Mammeniu!
Mammeniu!</i>” And a pair of gorilla-like arms
infolded a gaunt, wasted little figure wrapped
in a shawl.</p>

<p>“Moisheh! my heart!” she sobbed, devouring
him with hunger-ravaged eyes.</p>

<p>“<i>Ach!</i>” She trembled—drawing back to
survey her first-born. “From the bare feet and
rags of Smirsk to leather shoes and a suit like
a Rothschild!” she cried in Yiddish. “<i>Ach!</i>—I
lived to see America!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>A dumb thing laughing and crying he stood
there, a primitive figure, pathetic, yet sublime in
the purity of his passionate love, his first love—his
love for his mother.</p>

<p>The toil-worn little hand pulled at his neck
as she whispered in Moisheh’s ear, and as in a
dream he turned with outstretched arms to greet
his brothers.</p>

<p>“Feivel—<i>mein</i> doctor!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, we’re here,” said the high-browed
young doctor in a tone that I thought was a little
impatient. “Now let’s divide up these bundles
and get started.” Moisheh’s willing arms
reached out for the heaviest sack.</p>

<p>“And here is my <i>teacherin</i>!” Moisheh’s
grin was that of a small boy displaying his most
prized possession.</p>

<p>Berel, the baby, with the first down of young
manhood still soft on his cheeks, shyly enveloped
my hand in his long, sensitive fingers. “How
nice for you to come—a <i>teacherin</i>—an <i>Amerikanerin</i>!”</p>

<p>“Well—are we going?” came imperiously
from the doctor.</p>

<p>“Yeh—yeh!” answered Moisheh. “I’m
so out of my head from joy, my feet don’t work.”
And, gathering the few remaining lighter packages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
together, we threaded our way through the
crowded streets—the two newly arrived brothers
walking silently together.</p>

<p>“Has Moisheh changed much?” I asked
the doctor as I watched the big man help his
mother tenderly across the car tracks.</p>

<p>“The same Moisheh,” he said, with an
amused, slightly superior air.</p>

<p>I looked at Berel to see if he was of the
same cloth as the doctor, but he was lost in
dreamy contemplation of the towering sky-scrapers.</p>

<p>“Like granite mountains—the tower of
Babel,” Berel mused aloud.</p>

<p>“How do they ever walk up to the top?”
asked the bewildered old mother.</p>

<p>“Walk!” cried Moisheh, overjoyed at the
chance to hand out information. “There are
elevators in America. You push a button and
up you fly like on wings.”</p>

<p>Elated with this opportunity to show off his
superior knowledge, he went on: “I learned
myself to sign my name in America. Stop only
and I’ll read for you the sign from the lamp-post,”
and he spelled aloud, “W-a-l-l—Wall.”</p>

<p>“And what street is this?” asked the doctor,
as we came to another corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>Moisheh coloured with confusion, and the
eyes he raised to his brother were like the eyes
of a trapped deer pleading to be spared.
“L-i-b——” He stopped. “Oh, <i>weh</i>!” he
groaned, “the word is too long for me.”</p>

<p>“Liberty,” scorned the doctor. “You are
an <i>Amerikaner</i> already and you don’t know
Liberty?”</p>

<p>His own humiliation forgot in pride of his
brother’s knowledge, Moisheh nodded his head
humbly.</p>

<p>“Yeh—yeh! You a <i>greener</i> and yet you
know Liberty. And I, an <i>Amerikaner</i>, is stuck
by the word.” He turned to me with a pride
that brought tears to his eyes. “Didn’t I
tell you my brothers were high educated?
Never mind—they won’t shame me in
America.”</p>

<p>A look of adoration drank in the wonder of
his beloved family. Overcome with a sense of
his own unworthiness, he exclaimed, “Look only
on me—a nothing and a nobody.” He breathed
in my ear, “And such brothers!” With a new,
deeper tenderness, he pressed his mother’s slight
form more closely to him.</p>

<p>“More Bolsheviki!” scoffed a passer-by.</p>

<p>“Trotzky’s ambassadors,” sneered another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>And the ridicule was taken up by a number
of jeering voices.</p>

<p>“Poor devils!” came from a richly dressed
Hebrew, resplendent in his fur collar and a diamond
stud. There was in his eyes a wistful,
reminiscent look. Perhaps the sight of these
immigrants brought back to him the day he himself
had landed, barefoot and in rags, with
nothing but his dreams of America.</p>

<p>The street was thronged with hurrying lunch
seekers as we reached lower Broadway. I
glanced at Moisheh’s brothers, and I could not
help noticing how different was the calm and
carefree expression of their faces from the
furtive, frantic acquisitive look of the men in
the financial district.</p>

<p>But the moment we reached our block the
people from the stoops and windows waved their
welcome. Hanneh Breineh and all the boarders,
dressed up in their best, ran to meet us.</p>

<p>“Home!” cried the glowing Moisheh.
“<i>Mazel-tuff!</i> Good luck!” answered Hanneh
Breineh.</p>

<p>Instantly we were surrounded by the excited
neighbours whose voices of welcome rose above
the familiar cries of the hucksters and pedlars
that lined the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“Give a help!” commanded Hanneh
Breineh as she seized the bundles from
Moisheh’s numbed arms and divided them
among the boarders. Then she led the procession
triumphantly into her kitchen.</p>

<p>The table, with a profusion of festive dishes,
sang aloud its welcome.</p>

<p>“Rockefeller’s only daughter couldn’t wish
herself grander eatings by her own wedding,”
bragged the hostess as she waved the travellers
to the feast. A brass pot filled with <i>gefulte</i>
fish was under the festooned chandelier. A tin
platter heaped high with chopped liver and
onions sent forth its inviting aroma. <i>Tzimmes</i>—<i>blintzes</i>—a
golden-roasted goose swimming
in its own fat ravished the senses. Eyes and
mouths watered at sight of such luscious plenty.</p>

<p>“White bread!—<i>Ach!</i>—white bread!”
gasped the hunger-ravaged old mother. Reaching
across the table, she seized the loaf in her
trembling hands. “All those starving years—all
those years!” she moaned, kissing its flaky
whiteness as though it were a living thing.</p>

<p>“Sit yourself down—<i>mutterel</i>!” Hanneh
Breineh soothed the old woman and helped
her into the chair of honour. “White bread—even
white bread is nothing in America. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
the charities—a black year on them!—even the
charities give white bread to the beggars.”</p>

<p>Moisheh, beaming with joy of his loved ones’
nearness, was so busy passing and repassing the
various dishes to his folks that he forgot his
own meal.</p>

<p>“<i>Nu</i>—ain’t it time for you also to sit yourself
down like a person?” urged Hanneh
Breineh.</p>

<p>“<i>Tekeh—tekeh!</i>” added his mother. “Take
something to your mouth.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Moisheh rolled up his sleeves
and with the zest of a hungry caveman attacked
the leg of a goose. He no sooner finished than
he bent ravenously over the meat platter, his
forehead working in rhythm to his jaws.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” stammered Moisheh, wiping
his lips with the end of his shirt-sleeve and
sticking the meat on a fork.</p>

<p>“What’s the difference how you eat so long
you got what to eat?” broke in Zaretsky, grabbing
the breast of the goose and holding it to
his thick lips.</p>

<p>His sensibilities recoiling at this cannibalistic
devouring of food, Berel rose and walked to the
air-shaft window. His arms shot out as though
to break down the darkening wall which blotted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
out the daylight from the little room. “Plenty
of food for the body, but no light for the soul,”
he murmured, not intending to be heard.</p>

<p>Feivel, the doctor, lit a cigarette and walked
up and down the room restlessly. He stopped
and faced his younger brother with a cynical
smile. “I guess America is like the rest of the
world—you get what you take—sunlight as well
as other things——”</p>

<p>“How take sunlight? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean America is like a dish of cheese
<i>blintzes</i> at a poor house. The beggars who are
the head of the table and get their hands in
first, they live and laugh——”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh wiped her lips with the
corner of her apron and faced him indignantly.
“You ain’t yet finished with your first meal in
America and already you’re blowing from yourself
like it’s coming to you yet better.”</p>

<p>“But why come to America?” defended
Berel, the poet, “unless it gives you what’s
lacking in other lands? Even in the darkest
days in Russia the peasants had light and air.”</p>

<p>“Hey, Mr. Greenhorn Doctor—and you,
young feller,” broke in Zaretsky, the block
politician, “if you don’t like it here, then the
President from America will give you a free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
ride back on the same ship on which you came
from.”</p>

<p>Silenced by Zaretsky’s biting retort, the
doctor lit a cigarette and sent leisurely clouds
of smoke ceilingward.</p>

<p>Moisheh, who had been too absorbed in his
food to follow the talk, suddenly looked up
from his plate. Though unable to grasp the
trend of the conversation, he intuitively sensed
the hostile feeling in the room.</p>

<p>“Why so much high language,” he asked,
“when there’s yet the nuts and raisins and the
almonds to eat?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A few months later Hanneh Breineh came
into my room while peeling potatoes in her
apron. “Greenhorns ain’t what greenhorns
used to be,” she said, as she sat down on the
edge of my cot. “Once when greenhorns came,
a bone from a herring, a slice from an onion,
was to them milk and honey; and now pour
golden chicken fat into their necks, and they
turn up their nose like it’s coming to them yet
better.”</p>

<p>“What is it now?” I laughed.</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh rose. “Listen only to
what is going on,” she whispered, as she noiselessly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
pushed open the door and winked to me
to come over and hear.</p>

<p>“I’m yet in debt over my neck. In God’s
name, how could you spend out so much money
for only a little pleasure,” remonstrated Moisheh.</p>

<p>“Do you think I’m a <i>schnorrer</i> like you?
I’m a man, and I have to live,” retorted the
doctor.</p>

<p>“But two dollars for one evening in the
opera only, when for ten cents you could have
seen the grandest show in the movies!”</p>

<p>The doctor’s contemptuous glance softened
into a look of condescending pity. “After all,
my presser of pants, what a waste the opera
would be on you. Your America is the movies.”</p>

<p>“Two dollars!” cried the little old mother,
wringing her hands despairingly. “Moisheh
didn’t yet pay out for the ship tickets.”</p>

<p>“Ship tickets—bah!—I wish he had never
brought us to this golden country—dirt, darkness,
houses like stalls for cattle!” And in a
fury of disgust, not unmitigated with shame at
his loss of temper, he slammed the door behind
him.</p>

<p>“<i>Oi weh!</i>” wailed the careworn old mother.
“Two dollars for an opera, and in such bad
times!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Ach! Mammeniu</i>,” Moisheh defended,
“maybe Feivel ain’t like us. Remember he’s
high-educated. He needs the opera like I need
the bite of bread. Maybe even more yet. I
can live through without even the bite of bread,
but Feivel must have what wills itself in him.”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh closed the door and turned
to me accusingly. “What’s the use from all
your education, if that’s what kind of people it
makes?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I agreed with Hanneh Breineh.
“Education without heart is a curse.”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh bristled. “I wish I should
only be cursed with an education. It’s only by
the Americans education is nothing. It used to
be an honour in Russia to shine a doctor’s shoes
for him.”</p>

<p>“So you’re for education, after all?” I
ventured, trying the impossible—to pin Hanneh
Breineh down.</p>

<p>“Bloodsuckers!” Hanneh Breineh hissed.
“Moisheh dries out the marrow from his head
worrying for the dollar, and these high-educated
brothers sit themselves on top of his neck like
leeches. Greenhorns—opera—the world is
coming to an end!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>Work with the Immigration Department took
me to Washington for almost a year. As soon
as I returned to New York I went to the only
home I knew—Hanneh Breineh’s lodging-house.</p>

<p>My old friend, Moisheh, greeted me at the
door. “<i>Teacherin!</i>” he cried, with a shout of
welcome, and then called to his mother. “Come
quick. See only who is here!”</p>

<p>Sleeves rolled up and hands full of dough,
the little soul hurried in. “The sky is falling
to the earth!” she cried. “You here? And
are you going to stay?”</p>

<p>“Sure will she stay,” said Moisheh, helping
me remove my things.</p>

<p>“And where are Hanneh Breineh and the
boarders?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“Out on a picnic by Coney Island.”</p>

<p>“And why didn’t you and your mother go?”</p>

<p>“I got to cook Feivel’s dinner,” she gesticulated
with doughy palms.</p>

<p>“And I got my Coney Island here,” said
Moisheh.</p>

<p>To my great delight I saw he had been reading
the life of Lincoln—the book I had left him
the day I went away.</p>

<p>“My head is on fire thinking and dreaming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
from Lincoln. It shines before my face so real,
I feel myself almost talking to him.”</p>

<p>Moisheh’s eyes were alive with light, and as
I looked at him I felt for the first time a strange
psychic resemblance between Moisheh and Lincoln.
Could it be that the love for his hero
had so transformed him as to make him almost
resemble him?</p>

<p>“Lincoln started life as a nothing and a
nobody,” Moisheh went on, dreamily, “and he
made himself for the President from America—maybe
there’s yet a chance for me to make
something from myself?”</p>

<p>“Sure there is. Show only what’s in
you and all America reaches out to help
you.”</p>

<p>“I used to think that I’d die a presser by
pants. But since I read from Lincoln, something
happened in me. I feel I got something
for America—only I don’t know how to give it
out. I’m yet too much of a dummox——”</p>

<p>“What’s in us must come out. I feel
America needs you and me as much as she
needs her Rockefellers and Morgans. Rockefellers
and Morgans only pile up mountains of
money; we bring to America the dreams and
desires of ages—the youth that never had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
chance to be young—the choked lives that never
had a chance to live.”</p>

<p>A shadow filmed Moisheh’s brooding eyes.
“I can’t begin yet to think from myself for a
few years. First comes my brothers. If only
Feivel would work for himself up for a big
doctor and Berel for a big writer then I’ll feel
myself free to do something....</p>

<p>“Shah! I got great news for you,” Moisheh
announced. “Feivel has already his doctor’s
office.”</p>

<p>“Where did he get all the money?”</p>

<p>“On the instalment plan I got him the
chair and the office things. Now he’s beginning
to earn already enough to pay almost half
his rent.”</p>

<p>“Soon he’ll be for dinner.” The old lady
jumped up. “I got to get his eating ready
before he comes.” And she hastened back to
the kitchen stove.</p>

<p>“And Berel—what does he do?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Berel ain’t working yet. He’s still writing
from his head,” explained Moisheh. “Wait
only and I’ll call him. He’s locked himself up
in his bedroom; nobody should bother him.”</p>

<p>“Berel!” he called, tapping respectfully at
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Yuk!</i>” came in a voice of nervous irritation.
“What is it?”</p>

<p>“The <i>teacherin</i> is here,” replied Moisheh.</p>

<p>“Only a minute.”</p>

<p>“It’s me,” I added. “I’d like to see you.”</p>

<p>Berel came out, hair dishevelled, with dreamy,
absent look, holding pencil and paper in his
hand. “I was just finishing a poem,” he said
in greeting to me.</p>

<p>“I have been looking for your name in
the magazines. Have you published anything
yet?”</p>

<p>“I—publish in the American magazines?”
he flung, hurt beyond words. “I wouldn’t mix
my art with their empty drivel.”</p>

<p>“But, surely, there are some better magazines,”
I protested.</p>

<p>“Pshah! Their best magazines—the pink-and-white
jingles that they call poetry are not
worth the paper they’re printed on. America
don’t want poets. She wants plumbers.”</p>

<p>“But what will you do with the poetry you
write?”</p>

<p>“I’ll publish it myself. Art should be free,
like sunlight and beauty. The only compensation
for the artist is the chance to feed hungry
hearts. If only Moisheh could give me the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
hundred dollars I’d have my volume printed at
once.”</p>

<p>“But how can I raise all that money when
I’m not yet paid out with Feivel’s doctor’s
office?” remonstrated Moisheh. “Don’t you
think if—maybe you’d get a little job?”</p>

<p>An expression of abstraction came over
Betel’s face, and he snapped, impatiently:
“Yes—yes—I told you that I would look for
a job. But I must write this while I have the
inspiration.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you write your inspiration out in the
evening?” faltered Moisheh. “If you could
only bring in a few dollars a week to help pay
ourselves out to the instalment man.”</p>

<p>Berel looked at his brother with compassionate
tolerance. “What are to you the things of
the soul? All you care for is money—money—money!
You’d want me to sell my soul, my
poetry, my creative fire—to hand you a few
dirty dollars.”</p>

<p>The postman’s whistle and the cry, “Berel
Cinski!”</p>

<p>Moisheh hurried downstairs and brought back
a large return envelope.</p>

<p>“Another one of those letters back,” deplored
the mother, untactfully. “You’re only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
for making the post office rich with the stamps
from Moisheh’s blood money.”</p>

<p>“Dammit!” Defeat enraged the young
poet to the point of brutality. “Stop nagging
me and mixing in with things you don’t understand!”
He struck the rude table with his
clenched fist. “It’s impossible to live with
you thickheads—numskulls—money-grubbing
worms.”</p>

<p>He threw on his hat and coat and paused
for a moment glowering in the doorway. “Moisheh,”
he demanded, “give me a quarter for
car fare. I have to go uptown to the library.”
Silently the big brother handed him the money,
and Berel flung himself out of the room.</p>

<p>The door had no sooner closed on the poet
than the doctor sauntered into the room. After
a hasty “Hallo!” he turned to Moisheh. “I’ve
had a wonderful opportunity offered me—but I
can’t take advantage of it.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Moisheh, his face brightening.</p>

<p>“My landlord invited me to his house to-night,
to meet his only daughter.”</p>

<p>“Why not go?” demanded Moisheh.</p>

<p>“Sure you got to go,” urged the mother, as
she placed the food before him. “The landlord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
only got to see how smart you are and he’ll
pull you in the richest customers from uptown.”</p>

<p>Feivel looked at his clothes with resigned
contempt. “H—m,” he smiled bitterly. “Go
in this shabby suit? I have too much respect
for myself.”</p>

<p>There was troubled silence. Both brother
and mother were miserable that their dear one
should be so deprived.</p>

<p>Moisheh moved over to the window, a worried
look on his face. Presently he turned to his
brother. “I’d give you the blood from under
my nails for you but I’m yet so behind with the
instalment man.”</p>

<p>The doctor stamped his foot impatiently. “I
simply have to have a suit! It’s a question of
life and death.... Think of the chance! The
landlord took a liking to me—rich as Rockefeller—and
an only daughter. If he gives me a start
in an uptown office I could <i>coin</i> money. All I
need is a chance—the right location. Ten—twenty—fifty
dollars an hour. There’s no limit
to a dentist’s fee. If he sets me up on Riverside
Drive I could charge a hundred dollars for work
I get five for in Rutgers Street!”</p>

<p>“Can I tear myself in pieces? Squeeze the
money from my flesh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“But do you realize that, once I get uptown,
I could earn more in an hour than you could
in a month? I’ll pay you back every penny a
hundred times over.”</p>

<p>“<i>Nu</i>—tell me only—what can I do? Anything
you’ll say——”</p>

<p>“Why—you have your gold watch.”</p>

<p>Moisheh’s hand leaped to the watch in his
vest pocket. “My gold watch! My prize from
the night school?” he pleaded. “It ain’t just
a watch—it’s given me by the principal for never
being absent for a whole year.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot!—you, with your sentimentality!
Try to understand something once.” The doctor
waved his objections aside. “Once I get my
start in an uptown office I can buy you a dozen
watches. I’m telling you my whole future
depends on the front I put up at the landlord’s
house, and still you hesitate!”</p>

<p>Moisheh looked at his watch, fingering it.
His eyes filled with tears. “<i>Oi weh!</i>” he
groaned. “It’s like a piece from my heart.
My prize from the night school,” he mumbled,
brokenly; “but take it if you got to have it.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get it back,” confidently promised
the doctor, “get it back a hundred times over.”
And as he slipped the watch into his pocket,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
Moisheh’s eyes followed it doggedly. “So
long, <i>mammeniu</i>; no dinner for me to-day.”
Feivel bestowed a hasty good-bye caress upon
his old mother.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The doctor was now living in an uptown
boarding-house, having moved some weeks
before, giving the excuse that for his business
it was necessary to cultivate an uptown acquaintance.
But he still kept up his office in Rutgers
Street.</p>

<p>One morning after he had finished treating
my teeth, he took up a cigarette, nervously lit
it, attempted to smoke, and then threw it away.
I had never seen the suave, complacent man so
unnerved and fidgety. Abruptly he stopped in
front of me and smiled almost affectionately.</p>

<p>“You are the very person I want to speak
to this morning—you are the only person I want
to speak to,” he repeated.</p>

<p>I was a little startled, for his manner was
most unlike him. Seldom did he even notice
me, just as he did not notice most of Moisheh’s
friends. But his exuberant joyousness called
out my instinctive response, and before I knew
it I was saying, “If there’s anything I can do
for you I’ll be only too happy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>He took a bill from his pocket, placed it in
my hand, and said, with repressed excitement:
“I want you to take my mother and Moisheh
to see ‘Welcome Stranger.’ It’s a great show.
It’s going to be a big night with me, and I want
them to be happy, too.”</p>

<p>I must have looked puzzled, for he narrowed
his eyes and studied me, twice starting to speak,
and both times stopping himself.</p>

<p>“You must have thought me a selfish brute
all this time,” he began. “But I’ve only been
biding my time. I must make the most of myself,
and now is my only chance—to rise in the
world.”</p>

<p>He stopped again, paced the floor several
times, placed a chair before me, and said:
“Please sit down. I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>There was a wistful pleading in his voice
that none could resist, and for the first time I
was aware of the compelling humanness of this
arrogant intellectual.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you everything just as it is,” he
started. And then he stopped again. “<i>Ach!</i>”
he groaned. “There’s something I would like
to talk over with you—but I just can’t. You
wouldn’t understand.... A great thing is happening
in my life to-night—but I can’t confide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
it to anyone—none can understand. But—I
ask of you just this: will you give Moisheh
and my mother a good time? Let the poor
devils enjoy themselves for once?”</p>

<p>As I walked out of the office, the bill still
crumpled in my hand, I reproached myself for
my former harsh condemnation of the doctor.
Perhaps all those months, when I had thought
him so brutally selfish, he had been building
for the future.</p>

<p>But what was this mysterious good fortune
that he could not confide to anyone—and that
none could understand?</p>

<p>“Doctor Feivel gave me money to take you
to the theatre,” I announced as I entered the
house.</p>

<p>“Theatre!” chorused Moisheh and his
mother, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said. “Feivel seemed so happy to-day,
and he wanted you to share his happiness.”</p>

<p>“Feivel, the golden heart!” The old
mother’s eyes were misty with emotion.</p>

<p>“<i>Ach!</i> Didn’t I tell you even if my brother
is high-educated, he won’t shame himself from
us?” Moisheh faced me triumphantly. “I
was so afraid since he moved himself into an
uptown boarding-house that maybe we are losing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
him, even though he still kept up his office on
Rutgers Street.” Moisheh’s eyes shone with
delight.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you a little secret,” said he, leaning
forward confidentially. “I’m planning to give
a surprise to Feivel. In another month I’ll pay
myself out for the last of Feivel’s office things.
And for days and nights I’m going around
thinking and dreaming about buying him an
electric sign. Already I made the price with
the instalment man for it.” By this time his
recital was ecstatic. “And think only—what
<i>mein</i> doctor will say, when he’ll come one morning
from his uptown boarding-house and find
my grand surprise waiting for him over his office
door!”</p>

<p>All the way to the theatre Moisheh and his
mother drank in the glamour and the glitter of
the electric signs of Broadway.</p>

<p>“<i>Gottuniu!</i> If I only had the money for
such a sign for Feivel,” Moisheh sighed, pointing
to the chewing-gum advertisement on the
roof of a building near the Astor. “If I only
had Rockefeller’s money, I’d light up America
with Feivel’s doctor sign!”</p>

<p>When we reached the theatre, we found we
had come almost an hour too early.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind—<i>mammeniu</i>!” Moisheh took
his mother’s arm tenderly. “We’ll have time
now to walk ourselves along and see the riches
and lights from America.”</p>

<p>“I should live so,” he said, surveying his
mother affectionately. “That red velvet waist
and this new shawl over your head makes your
face so shine, everybody stops to give a look on
you.”</p>

<p>“Yeh—yeh! You’re always saying love
words to every woman you see.”</p>

<p>“But this time it’s my mother, so I mean it
from my heart.”</p>

<p>Moisheh nudged me confidentially.
“<i>Teacherin!</i> See only how a little holiday
lifts up my <i>mammeniu</i>! Don’t it dance from
her eyes the joy like from a young girl?”</p>

<p>“Stop already making fun from your old
mother.”</p>

<p>“You old?” Moisheh put his strong arm
around his mother’s waist. “Why, people
think we’re a young couple on our honeymoon.”</p>

<p>“Honeymoon—<i>ach</i>!” The faded face
shone with inward visioning. “My only wish
is to see for my eyes my sons marry themselves
in good luck. What’s my life—but only the
little hope from my children? To dance with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
the bride on my son’s wedding will make me the
happiest mother from America.”</p>

<p>“Feivel will soon give you that happiness,”
responded Moisheh. “You know how the
richest American-born girls are trying to catch
on to him. And no matter how grand the girl
he’ll marry himself to, you’ll have the first place
of honour by the wedding.”</p>

<p>As we turned in at Forty-fifth Street a
curious crowd blocked our path. A row of sleek
limousines stood before the arched entrance of
the Van Suydden Hotel.</p>

<p>“Look only—a wedding! Let’s give a look
on the bride!” exclaimed Moisheh’s mother,
eagerly. A wedding was, in her religion, the
most significant ceremony in life. And for her
sake we elbowed our way towards the front.</p>

<p>A procession of bridesmaids in shimmering
chiffons, bedecked with flowers, were the first to
tread the carpeted steps.</p>

<p>Then we saw the bride.... And then——Good
God!—was it possible?</p>

<p>Moisheh clutched his mother’s hand convulsively.
Could it really be their Feivel?</p>

<p>The two stood gaping blindly, paralysed by
the scene before them.</p>

<p>Suddenly—roused by the terrible betrayal—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
mother uttered a distorted sob of grief.
“Feivel—son <i>mein</i>! What have you done to
me?”</p>

<p>Moisheh grasped the old woman more firmly
as the bride tossed her head coquettishly and
turned possessive eyes on her husband—their
son and brother.</p>

<p>The onlookers murmured appreciatively,
thrilled by the pretty romance.</p>

<p>Enraged by the stupid joy of the crowd which
mocked her misery, the old mother broke from
Moisheh’s hold with wiry strength and clawed
wildly at the people around her.</p>

<p>“Feivel—black curses——!” she hissed—and
then she crumpled, fainting, into Moisheh’s
arms.</p>

<p>Unaware of the disturbance outside, the
happy couple passed into the festive reception
hall.</p>

<p>With quick self-control, Moisheh motioned to
a taxicab out of which had just emerged another
wedding guest. Then he gently lifted the fainting
form of the little mother in beside him.</p>

<p>And all through the night the bitter tears of
betrayed motherhood poured over the shrunken
bosom where Feivel, as a suckling infant, had
once helped himself to life.</p>

<h3>§ 1</h3>

<p>“There are too many writers and too few
cooks.” The dean laughed at her outright.
His superior glance placed her. “The trouble
with you is that you are a Russian Jewess. You
want the impossible.”</p>

<p>Sophie Sapinsky’s mouth quivered at the
corners, and her teeth bit into the lower lip to
still its trembling.</p>

<p>“How can you tell what’s possible in me
before I had a chance?” she said.</p>

<p>“My dear child”—Dean Lawrence tried to
be kind—“the magazine world is overcrowded
with native-born writers who do not earn their
salt. What chance is there for you, with your
immigrant English? You could never get rid
of your foreign idiom. Quite frankly, I think
you are too old to begin.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so old like I look.” Sophie heard
a voice that seemed to come from somewhere
within her speak for her. “I’m only old from
the crushed-in things that burn me up. It dies in
me, my heart, if I don’t give out what’s in me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“My dear young woman”—the dean’s broad
tolerance broke forth into another laugh—“you
are only one of the many who think that they
have something to say that the world is languishing
to hear.” His easy facetiousness stung her
into further vehemence.</p>

<p>“But I’m telling you I ain’t everybody.”
With her fist she struck his desk, oblivious of
what she was doing. “I’m smart from myself,
not from books. I never had a chance when I
was young, so I got to <i>make my chance</i> when
I’m ‘too old.’ I feel I could yet be younger
than youth if I could only catch on to the work
I love.”</p>

<p>“Take my advice. Retain the position that
assures you a living. Apply yourself earnestly
to it, and you will secure a measure of satisfaction.”</p>

<p>The dean turned to the mahogany clock on
his desk. Sophie Sapinsky was quick to take
the hint. She had taken up too much of his
time, but she could not give up without another
effort.</p>

<p>“I can’t make good at work that chokes me.”</p>

<p>“Well, then see the head of the English
department,” he said, with a gesture of dismissal.</p>

<p>The professor of English greeted Sophie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
with a tired, lifeless smile that fell like ashes
on her heart. A chill went through her as she
looked at his bloodless face. But the courage
of despair drove her to speak.</p>

<p>“I wasted all my youth slaving for bread,
but now I got to do what I want to do. For
me—oh, you can’t understand—but for me, it’s
a case of life or death. I got to be a writer,
and I want to take every course in English and
literature from the beginning to the end.”</p>

<p>The professor did not laugh at Sophie Sapinsky
as the dean had done. He had no life left
for laughter. But his cold scrutiny condemned
her.</p>

<p>“I know,” she pleaded, “I ain’t up to those
who had a chance to learn from school, but
inside me I’m always thinking from life, just
like Emerson. I understand Emerson like he
was my own brother. And he says: ‘Trust
yourself. Hold on to the thoughts that fly
through your head, and the world has got to
listen to you even if you’re a nobody.’ Ideas
I got plenty. What I want to learn from the
college is only the words, the quick language
to give out what thinks itself in me—just like
Emerson.”</p>

<p>The preposterous assumption of this ignorant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
immigrant girl in likening herself to the revered
sage of Concord staggered the professor. He
coughed.</p>

<p>“Well—er”—he paused to get the exact
phrase to set her right—“Emerson, in his philosophy,
assumed a tolerant attitude that, unfortunately,
the world does not emulate. Perhaps
you remember the unhappy outcome of your
English entrance examination.”</p>

<p>Sophie Sapinsky reddened painfully. The
wound of her failure was still fresh.</p>

<p>“In order to be eligible for our regular
college courses, you would have to spend two
or three years in preparation.”</p>

<p>Blindly, Sophie turned to go. She reached
for the door. The professor’s perfunctory good-bye
fell on deaf ears.</p>

<p>She swung the door open. The president of
the college stood before her. She remembered
it was he who had welcomed the extension
students on the evening of her first attendance.
He moved deferentially aside for her to pass.
For one swift instant Sophie looked into kindly
eyes. “Could he understand? Should I cry
out to him to help me?” flashed through her
mind. But before she could say a word he
passed and the door had closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>Sophie stopped in the hall. Had she the
courage to wait until he came out? “He’s got
feelings,” her instincts urged her. “He’s not
an <i>all-rightnik</i>, a stone heart like the rest of
them.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ach!</i>” cried her shattered spirit, “what
would he, the head of them all, have to do with
me? He wouldn’t even want to stop to listen.”</p>

<p>Too crushed to endure another rebuff, she
dragged her leaden feet down the stairs and out
into the street. All the light went out of her
eyes, the strength out of her arms and fingers.
She could think or feel nothing but the choked
sense of her defeat.</p>

<p>That night she lay awake staring into the
darkness. Every nerve within her cried aloud
with the gnawing ache of her unlived life. Out
of the dim corners the spectre of her stunted
girlhood rose to mock her—the wasted, poverty-stricken
years smothered in the steaming pots
of other people’s kitchens. “Must I always
remain buried alive in the black prison of my
dumbness? Can’t I never learn to give out
what’s in me? Must I choke myself in the
smoke of my own fire?”</p>

<p>Centuries of suppression, generations of
illiterates, clamoured in her: “Show them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
what’s in you! If you can’t write in college
English, write in ‘immigrant English.’”</p>

<p>She flung from her the college catalogue.
About to trample on it, she stopped. The catalogue
had fallen open at the photograph of the
president. There looked up at her the one
kind face in that heartless college world. The
president’s eyes gazed once more steadily into
hers. Sophie hesitated; but not to be thwarted
of her vengeance, she tore out his picture and
laid it on the table, then she ripped the catalogue,
and stuffed the crumpled pages into the
stove. It roared up the chimney like the song
of the Valkyrie. She threw back her head with
triumph, and once more her eyes met the
president’s.</p>

<p>“Let them burn, these dead-heads. Who
are they, the bosses of education? What are
they that got the say over me if I’m fit to learn
or not fit to learn? Dust and ashes, ashes and
dust. But you,” she picked up the picture,
“you still got some life. But if you got life,
don’t their dry dust choke you?”</p>

<p>The wrestlings of her sleepless night only
strengthened her resolve to do the impossible,
just because it seemed impossible. “I can’t
tear the stars out of heaven if it wills itself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
me,” her youth cried in her. “Whether I know
how to write or don’t know how to write, I’ll be
a writer.”</p>


<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p>She was at the steaming stove of the restaurant
at the usual hour the next morning. She
stewed the same <i>tzimmas</i>, fried the same <i>blintzee</i>,
stuffed the same <i>miltz</i>. But she was no longer
the same. Her head was in a whirl with golden
dreams of her visionary future.</p>

<p>All at once a scream rent the air.</p>

<p>“<i>Koosh!</i> where in goodness’ name is your
head?” thundered her employer. “The <i>blintzee</i>
burning in front of her nose, and she stands
there like a <i>yok</i> with her eyes in the air!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” she mumbled in confusion,
setting down the pan. “I was only thinking
for a minute.”</p>

<p>“Thinking!” His greasy face purpled
with rage. “Do I pay you to think or to cook?
For what do I give you such wages? What’s
the world coming to? <i>Pfui!</i> A cook, a greenhorn,
a nothing—also me a thinker!”</p>

<p>Sophie’s eyes flamed.</p>

<p>“Maybe in Smyrna, from where you come,
a cook is a nothing. In America everybody is
a person.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“Bolshevik!” he yelled. “Look only what
fresh mouths the unions make from them! Y’understand
me, in my restaurant one thing on a
time: you cook or you think. If you wan’ to
think, you’ll think outside.”</p>

<p>“All right, then; give me my wages!” she
retorted, flaring up. “The Tsar is dead. In
America cooks are also people.”</p>

<p>Sophie tore off her apron, and thrust it at
the man.</p>

<p>To the cheapest part of the East Side she
went in her search for a room. Through the
back alleys and yards she sought for a place that
promised to be within her means. And then a
smeared square of cardboard held between the
iron grating of a basement window caught her
eye. “Room to let—a bargain—cheap!”</p>

<p>“Only three dollars a month,” said the
woman in answer to Sophie’s inquiry.</p>

<p>The girl opened a grimy window that faced
a blank wall.</p>

<p>“<i>Oi, weh!</i> not a bit of air!”</p>

<p>“What do you need yet air for the winter?”
cried Hanneh Breineh. “When the cold comes,
the less air that blows into your room, the
warmer you can keep yourself. And when it
gets hot in summer you can take your mattress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
up on the roof. Everybody sleeps on the roof
in summer.”</p>

<p>“But there’s so little light,” said Sophie.</p>

<p>“What more light do you yet need? A
room is only for to sleep by night. When you
come home from work, it’s dark, anyway. <i>Gottuniu!</i>
it’s so dark on my heart with trouble,
what difference does it make a little darkness in
the room?”</p>

<p>“But I have to work in my room all day. I
must have it light.”</p>

<p>“<i>Nu</i>, I’ll let you keep the gas lighted all
day long,” Hanneh Breineh promised.</p>

<p>“Three dollars a month,” deliberated
Sophie. The cheapness would give her a sense of
freedom that would make up for the lack of light
and air. She paid down her first month’s rent.</p>

<p><i>Her</i> house, securely hers. Yet with the flash
of triumph came a stab of bitterness. All that
was hers was so wretched and so ugly! Had
her eager spirit, eager to give, no claim to a bit
of beauty, a shred of comfort?</p>

<p>Over the potato-barrel she flung a red shawl,
once her mother’s, and looked through her bag
for something to cover an ugly break in the
plaster. She could find nothing but the page
torn from the college catalogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“It’s not so sunny and airy here as in your
college office,” she said, tacking the photograph
on the wall; “but maybe you’d be a realer man
if once in your life you had to put up with a
hole like this for a room.”</p>

<p>Sophie spread her papers on the cot beside
her. With tense fingers she wrote down the
title of her story, then stopped, and stared
wildly at the ceiling.</p>

<p>Where was the vision that had haunted her
all these days? Where were the thoughts and
feelings that surged like torrents through her
soul? Merely the act of putting her pencil to
paper, her thoughts became a blur, her feelings
a dumb ache in her heart.</p>

<p><i>Ach</i>, why must she kill herself to say what
can never be said in words? But how did
Emerson and Shakespeare seize hold of their
vision? What was the source of their deathless
power?</p>

<p>The rusty clock struck six.</p>

<p>“I ought to run out now for the stale bread,
or it will be all sold out, and I will have to pay
twice as much for the fresh,” flashed through
her mind.</p>

<p>“<i>Oi weh!</i>” she wailed, covering her eyes,
“it’s a stomach slave I am, not a writer. I forget<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
my story, I forget everything, thinking only
of saving a few pennies.”</p>

<p>She dragged herself back to the page in front
of her and resumed her task with renewed vigour.</p>

<p>“Sarah Lubin was sixteen years old when
she came to America. She came to get an
education, but she had to go to a factory for
bread,” she wrote laboriously, and then drew
back to study her work. The sentences were
wooden, dead, inanimate things. The words
laughed up at her, mockingly.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was not a writer, after all.
Writers never started stories in this way. Her
eyes wandered over to the bed, a hard, meagre
cot. “I must remember to fix the leg, or it will
tip to-night,” she mused.</p>

<p>“Here I am,” she cried despairingly, “thinking
of my comforts again! And I thought I’d
want nothing; I’d live only to write.” Her
head sank to the rough edge of the potato-barrel.
“Perhaps I was a fool to give up all
for this writing.”</p>

<p>“Too many writers and too few cooks”:
the dean’s words closed like a noose around her
anguished soul.</p>

<p>When she looked up, the kind face of the
college president smiled down at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“Then what is it in me that’s tearing and
gnawing and won’t let me rest?” she pleaded.
The calm faith of the eyes levelled steadily at
her seemed to rebuke her despair. The sure
faith of that lofty face lifted her out of herself.
She was humble before such unwavering power.
“<i>Ach!</i>” she prayed, “how can I be so sure like
you? Help me!”</p>

<p>Sophie became a creature possessed. She
lived for one idea, was driven by one resistless
passion, to write. As the weeks and months
passed and her savings began to dwindle, her
cheeks grew paler and thinner, the shadows
under her restless eyes were black hollows of
fear.</p>

<p>There came a day more deadly than death,
when she had to face failure. She took out the
thinning wad from her stocking and counted out
her remaining cash: one, two, three dollars, and
some nickels and dimes. How long before the
final surrender? If she kept up her rigorous
ration of dry bread and oatmeal, two or three
weeks more at most. And then?</p>

<p>An end to dreams. An end to ambition.
Back to the cook-stove, back to the stifling smells
of <i>tzimmas</i>, hash, and <i>miltz</i>.</p>

<p>No, she would never let herself sink back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
the kitchen. But where could she run from the
terror of starvation?</p>

<p>The bitterest barb of her agony was her inability
to surrender. She was crushed, beaten,
but she could not give up the battle. The unvoiced
dream in her still clamoured and ached
and strained to find voice. A resistless something
in her that transcended reason rose up in
defiance of defeat.</p>


<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p>“A black year on the landlord!” screamed
Hanneh Breineh through the partition. “The
rent he raised, so what does he need to worry
yet if the gas freezes? <i>Gottuniu!</i> freeze should
only the marrow from his bones!”</p>

<p>Sophie turned back to the little stove in an
attempt to light the gas under the pan of oatmeal.
The feeble flame flickered and with a
faint protest went out. Hanneh Breineh poked
in her tousled head for sympathy.</p>

<p>“Woe is me! Woe on the poor what ain’t
yet sick enough for the hospital!”</p>

<p>As the chill of the gathering dusk intensified,
Sophie seemed to see herself carried out on a
stretcher to the hospital, numb, frozen.</p>

<p>“God from the world! better a quick death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
than this slow freezing!” With the perpetual
gnawing of hunger sapping her strength, Sophie
had not the courage to face another night of
torment. Drawing her shabby shawl more
tightly around her, she hurried out. “Where
now?” she asked as a wave of stinging snow
blinded her. Hanneh Breineh’s words came
back to her: “the hospital!” Why not?
Surely they couldn’t refuse to shelter her just
overnight in a storm like this.</p>

<p>But when she reached the Beth Israel her
heart sank. She looked in timidly at the warm,
beckoning lights.</p>

<p>“<i>Ach!</i> how can I have the gall to ask them
to take me in? They’ll think I’m only a beggar
from the street.”</p>

<p>She paced the driveway of the building, back
and forth and up and down, in envy of the sick
who enjoyed the luxury of warmth.</p>

<p>“To the earth with my healthy body!” she
cursed. “Why can’t I only break a bone or
something?”</p>

<p>With a sudden courage of despair she
mounted the steps to the superintendent’s office;
but one glance of the man’s well-fed face robbed
her of her nerve.</p>

<p>She sank down on the bench of the waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
applicants, glancing stealthily at the others,
feeling all the guilt of a condemned criminal.</p>

<p>When her turn came, the blood in her ears
pounded from terror and humiliation. She
could not lift her eyes from the floor to face this
feelingless judge of the sick and the suffering.</p>

<p>“I’m so killed with the cold,” she stammered,
twisting the fringes of her shawl. “If I could
only warm myself up in a bed for the night——”</p>

<p>The man looked at her suspiciously.</p>

<p>“If we fill up our place with people like
you, we’ll have no room left for the sick. We
have a ’flu epidemic.”</p>

<p>“So much you’re doing for the ’flu people,
why can’t you help me before I get it?” She
spoke with that suppressed energy which was the
keynote of her whole personality.</p>

<p>“Have you a fever?” he asked, his professional
eye arrested by the unnatural flush on her
face.</p>

<p>“Fever?” she mumbled. “A person has
got to be already dead in his coffin before you’d
lift a finger to help.” She sped from the office
into the dreary reception-hall.</p>

<p>On her way out her eye was caught by the
black-faced type on the cover of a magazine that
lay on the centre-table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center caption">SHORT-STORY COMPETITION</p>

<p class="center"><i>A Five-Hundred-Dollar Prize for
the Best Love-Story of a Working-Girl</i></p>
</div>

<p>As she read the magical words, the colour
rushed to her cheeks. Forgotten was the
humiliation of the superintendent’s refusal to
take her in, forgotten were the cold, the hunger.
Her whole being leaped at the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Write your own love-story, but if you have
never lived love, let it be your dream of love.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Your dream of love.” The words were as
wine in her blood. Was there ever a girl who
hungered and dreamed of love as she? It was
as though in the depths of her poverty and want
the fates had challenged her to give substance
to her dreams. She stumbled out of the huge
building, her feet in the snow, her mind in the
clouds.</p>

<p>“God from the world! the gas is burning
again!” cried Hanneh Breineh as she groped
her way back into her cellar-room. “The children
are dancing over the fire like for a holiday.
All day they had nothing to warm in their bellies,
and the coffee tastes like wine from heaven.”</p>

<p>“Wine from heaven!” repeated the girl.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
“What wine but love from heaven?” and she
clutched the magazine more tightly to her
shrunken chest.</p>

<p>In the flicker of the gas-jet the photograph
on the wall greeted her like a living thing.
With the feel of the steady gaze upon her, she
re-read the message that was to her an invitation
and a challenge; and as she read, the
dingy little room became alive with light. The
understanding eyes seemed to pour vision into
her soul. What was the purpose of all the
harsh experiences that had been hers till now
but to make her see just this, that love, and
love only, was the one vital force of life? What
was the purpose of all the privation and want
she had endured but to make her see more poignantly
this ethereal essence of love? The walls
of her little room dissolved. The longing for
love that lay dumb within her all her years took
shape in human form. More real than life,
closer than the beat within her heart, was this
radiant, all-consuming vision that possessed her.</p>

<p>She groped for pencil and paper and wrote,
unaware that she was writing. It was as though
a hand stronger than her own was laid upon
hers. Her power seemed to come from some
vast, fathomless source. The starved passions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
of all the starved ages poured through her in
rhythmic torrent of words—words that flashed
and leaped with the resistless fire of youth burning
through generations of suppression.</p>

<p>Not until daylight filtered through the grating
of her window did the writing cease, nor was
she aware of any fatigue. An ethereal lightness,
a sense of having escaped from the trammels of
her body, lifted her as on wings. Her radiant
face met the responsive glow of understanding
that shone down on her from the wall. “It’s
your light shining through me,” she exulted.
“It’s your kind eyes looking into mine that
made my dumbness speak.”</p>

<p>For the moment the contest was forgotten.
She was seized by an irresistible impulse to take
her outpourings to the man who had inspired
her. “Let him only see what music he made
of me.” Gathering tightly to her heart the
scribbled sheets of paper, she hurried to the
university.</p>

<p>A whole hour she waited at his office door.
As she saw him coming, she could wait no longer,
but ran towards him.</p>

<p>“Read it only,” she said, thrusting the manuscript
at the bewildered man. “I’ll be back in
an hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“What exotic creature was this, with her
scattered pages of scrawling script and eager
eyes?” President Irvine wondered. He concluded
she was one of the immigrant group
before which he had lectured.</p>


<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p>She returned, to find the manuscript still in
his hand.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he asked with an enthusiasm
new to him, “where did you get all this?”</p>

<p>“From the hunger in me. I was born to
beat out the meaning of things out of my own
heart.”</p>

<p>Puzzled, he studied her. She was thin,
gaunt, with a wasting power of frustrated passion
in young flesh. There was the shadow of blank
nights staring out of her eyes. Here was a
personality, he thought, who might reveal to him
those intangible qualities of the immigrant—qualities
he could not grasp, which baffled,
fascinated him.</p>

<p>He questioned her, and she poured out her
story to him with eager abandon.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t be an actress or a singer, because
you got to be young and pretty for that; but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
a writer nobody cares who or what you are
so long as the thoughts you give out are
beautiful.”</p>

<p>He laughed, and it was an appreciative,
genial laugh.</p>

<p>“You ain’t at all like a professor, cold and
hard like ice. You are a person so real,” she
naïvely said, interrupting the tale of her early
struggles, her ambitions, and the repulse that
had been hers in this very university of his.
And then in sudden apprehension she cried
out: “Maybe the dean and the English professor
were right. Maybe only those with a long
education get a hearing in America. If you
would only fix this up for me—change the
immigrant English.”</p>

<p>“Fix it up?” he protested. “There are
things in life bigger than rules of grammar.
The thing that makes art live and stand out
throughout the ages is sincerity. Unfortunately,
education robs many of us of the power to give
spontaneously, as mother earth gives, as the
child gives.</p>

<p>“You have poured out not a part, but the
whole of yourself. That’s why it can’t be measured
by any of the prescribed standards. It’s
uniquely you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>Her face lighted with joy at his understanding.</p>

<p>“I never knew why I hated to be Americanized.
I was always burning to dig out the
thoughts from my own mind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your power lies in that you are yourself.
Your message is that of your people, and
it is all the stronger because you are not a so-called
assimilated immigrant.”</p>

<p><i>Ach!</i> just to hear him talk! It was like the
realization of a power in life itself to hold her
up and carry her to the heights.</p>

<p>“Will you leave this manuscript here, so I
can have my secretary type it for you?” he
asked as he took her to the door. “I can
have it done easily. And I shall write you
when I’ll have time for another long talk about
your work.”</p>

<p>Only after she had left did she fully realize
the wonder of this man’s kindness.</p>

<p>“That’s America,” she whispered. “Where
but in America could something so beautiful
happen? A crazy, choked-in thing like me and
him such a gentleman talking together about art
and life like born equals. I poverty, and he
plenty; I ignorance, and he knowledge; I from
the bottom, and he from the top, and yet he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
making me feel like we were from always
friends.”</p>

<p>A few days later the promised note came.
How quick he was with his help, as if she were
his only concern! Bare-headed, uncoated, she
ran to him, this prince of kindness, repeating
over and over again the words of the letter.</p>

<p>Her spirit crashed to the ground when she
learned that he had been suddenly called to a
conference at Washington. “He would return
in a fortnight,” said the model-mannered secretary
who answered her feverish questions.</p>

<p>Wait a fortnight? She couldn’t. Why, the
contest would be over by that time. Then it
struck her, the next best thing—the professor of
English. With a typewritten manuscript in her
hand, he must listen to her. And just to be admitted
to his short-story class for one criticism
was all she would ask.</p>

<p>But small a favour as it seemed to her, it
was greater than the professor was in a position
to grant.</p>

<p>“To concede to your request would establish
a precedent that would be at variance with the
university regulations,” he vouchsafed.</p>

<p>“University regulations, precedents? What
are you talking?” And clutching at his sleeve,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
hysterically, she pleaded: “Just this once, my
life hangs on getting this story perfect, and you
can save me by this one criticism.”</p>

<p>Her burning desire knew no barrier, recognized
no higher authority. And the professor,
contrary to his reason, contrary to his experienced
judgment, yielded without knowing why to the
preposterous demands of this immigrant girl.</p>

<p>In the end of the last row of the lecture-hall
Sophie waited breathlessly for the professor to
get to her story. After a lifetime of waiting it
came. As from a great distance she heard him
announce the title.</p>

<p>“This was not written by a member of the
class,” he went on, “but is the attempt of a
very ambitious young person. Its lack of form
demonstrates the importance of the fundamentals
of technique in which we have drilled.”</p>

<p>His reading aloud of the manuscript was
followed by a chorus of criticism—criticism that
echoed the professor’s own sentiments: “It’s
not a story; it has no plot”; “feeling without
form”; “erotic, over-emotional.”</p>

<p>She could hardly wait for the hour to be over
to get back this living thing of hers that they
were killing. When she left the class all the air
seemed to have gone out of her lungs. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
dragged her leaden feet back to her room and
sank on her cot a heap of despair.</p>

<p>All at once she jumped up.</p>

<p>“What do they know, they, with only their
book-learning?” If the president had understood
her story, there might be others who would
understand. She must have faith enough in
herself to send it forth for a judgment of a
world free from rules of grammar. In a fury of
defiance she mailed the story.</p>


<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p>Weeks of tortuous waiting for news of the
contest followed—weeks when she dogged the
postman’s footsteps and paced the lonely streets
in restless suspense. How could she ever have
hoped to win the prize? Why was she so starving
for the golden hills on the sky? If only
for one day she could stop wasting her heart for
the impossible!</p>

<p>Exhausted, spent, she lay on her cot when
Hanneh Breineh, more than usually disturbed
by the girl’s driven look, opened the door softly.</p>

<p>“Here you got it, a letter. I hope it’s such
good luck in it as the paper is fine.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Hanneh Breineh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
in alarm at the girl’s sudden pallor as the empty
envelope fluttered from limp fingers.</p>

<p>For answer Sophie held up the cheque.</p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars,” she cried, “and the
winner of the first prize!”</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh felt the cheque. She read
it. It was actually true. Five hundred dollars!
In a flurry of excitement she called the neighbours
in the hall-ways, and then hurried to the
butcher, pushing through the babbling women
who crowded around the counter. “People
listen only! My <i>roomerkeh</i> got a five-hundred-dollar
prize!”</p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars?” The words
leaped from lips to lips like fire in the air.
“<i>Ach!</i> only the little bit of luck! Did she win
it on the lotteree?”</p>

<p>“Not from the lottery. Just wrote something
from her head. And you ought to see her, only
a dried-up bone of a girl, and yet so smart.”</p>

<p>In a few moments Sophie was mobbed in her
cellar by the gesticulating crowd of women who
hurried in to gaze upon the miracle of good
luck. With breathless awe hands felt her,
and, reverently, the cheque. Yes, even mouths
watered with an envy that was almost worship.
They fell on her neck and kissed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“May we all live to have such luck to get
rich quick!” they chorused.</p>

<p>The following day Sophie’s picture was in
the Jewish evening paper. The Ghetto was
drunk with pride because one of their number,
and “only a dried-up bone of a girl,” had written
a story good enough to be printed in a magazine
of America. Their dreams of romance had
found expression in the overwhelming success
of this greenhorn cook.</p>

<p>In one day Sophie was elevated to a position
of social importance by her achievement. When
she walked in the street, people pointed at her
with their fingers. She was deluged with requests
“to give a taste” of the neighbours’
cooking.</p>

<p>When she went to the baker for her usual
stale bread, the man picked out the finest loaf.</p>

<p>“Fresh bread for you in honour of your good
luck. And here’s yet an apple <i>strudel</i> for good
measure.” Nor would he take the money she
offered. “Only eat it with good health. I’m
paid enough with the honour that somebody with
such luck steps into my store.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” explained Hanneh Breineh.
“People will give you the last bite from their
mouth when you’re lucky, because you don’t need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
their favours. But if you’re poor, they’re afraid
to be good to you, so you should not hang on
their necks for help.”</p>

<p>But the greatest surprise that awaited Sophie
was the letter from the professor congratulating
her upon her success.</p>

<p>“The students have unanimously voted you
to be their guest of honour at luncheon on Saturday,”
it read. “May we hope for the honour
of your company on that occasion?”</p>

<p>The sky is falling to the earth—she a guest
of honour of a well-fed, well-dressed world!
She to break bread with those high up in rules
of grammar! Sophie laughed aloud for the first
time in months. Lunch at the hotel! A vision
of snowy tablecloths, silver forks, delicate china,
and sparkling glasses dazzled her. Yes, she
would go, and go as she was. The clothes that
had been good enough to starve and struggle in
must be good enough to be feasted and
congratulated in.</p>

<p>She was surprised at the sense of cold
detachment with which she entered the hotel
lobby.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s my excuse to myself for going
that makes me feel that I’m so above it,” she
told herself. The grandeur, the lights, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
lustre, and glamour of the magnificent hotel—she
took it all in, her nose in the air.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the banquet-hall stood the
professor, smiling, smiling. And all these people
in silks and furs and broadcloth wanted to shake
hands with her. Again, without knowing why,
she longed to laugh aloud.</p>

<p>Not until Professor ——, smiling more
graciously than ever, reached the close of his
speech, not until he referred to her for the third
time as having reached “the stars through difficulties,”
did she realize that she who had looked
on, she who had listened, she who had wanted
so to laugh, was a person quite different from the
uncouth girl with the shabby sweater and broken
shoes whom the higher-ups were toasting and
flattering.</p>

<p>“I’ve never made a talk yet in my life,”
she said in answer to the calls for “Speech!
speech!” “But these are grand words from
the professor, ‘to the stars through difficulties.’”
She looked around on these stars of the college
world whom, after all her struggles, she had
reached. “Yes, ‘to the stars through difficulties.’”
She nodded with a queer little smile,
and sat down amidst a shower of applause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>


<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p>In a daze Sophie left the heated banquet-hall.
She walked blindly, struggling to get hold
of herself, struggling in vain. Every reality,
every human stay, seemed to slip from her. A
stifled sense of emptiness weighed her down
like a dead weight.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with me?” she cried.
“Why do the higher-ups crush me so with
nothing? Why is their smiling politeness only
a hidden hurt in my heart?”</p>

<p>The flattering voices, the puppet-like smiles,
the congratulations that sounded like mockery,
were now so distant, so unreal as was the girl
with her nose in the air. What cared these
people wrapped in furs that the winter wind
pierced through her shabby sweater? What
cared they if her heart died in her from loneliness?</p>

<p>An aching need for human fellowship pressed
upon her, a need for someone who cared for
her regardless of failure or success. In a sudden
dimming of vision she saw the only real look of
sympathy that had ever warmed her soul. Of
them all, this man with the understanding eyes
had known that what she wanted to say was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
worth saying before it got into print. If she
could only see him—him himself!</p>

<p>If she could only pass the building where
he was she would feel calm and serene again!
All her bitterness and resentment would dissolve,
all her doubts turn to faith. Who knows?
Perhaps he had come back already. Her feet
seemed winged as they flew without her will,
almost without her consciousness, towards the
place where she thought he might be.</p>

<p>As she ran up the steps she knew he was
there without being told. Even as she sent her
name in, the door opened, and he stood there,
the living light of the late afternoon glow.</p>

<p>He wasn’t a bit startled by her sudden appearance.
He merely greeted her, and led her
in silence to his inner study. But there was
a quality about the silence that made her
feel at ease, as though he had been expecting
her.</p>

<p>“I have things to say to you,” she faltered.
“Do you have time?”</p>

<p>For answer he pushed closer to the blazing
logs an easy chair, and motioned her into it.</p>

<p>There no longer seemed any need to say
what she had planned. His mere presence filled
her with a healing peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“And it was so black for my eyes only a
while before!” She spoke aloud her thought
and paused, embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Black for your eyes?” he repeated, leaning
towards her with an inviting interest.</p>

<p>“You know I was first on the table by the
hotel?”</p>

<p>His eyebrows lifted whimsically.</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” he urged.</p>

<p>“All those higher-ups what didn’t care a
pinch of salt for me myself making such a fuss
over a little accident of good luck!”</p>

<p>“Accident! You have won your way inch
by inch grappling with life.” His calm, compelling
look seemed to flood her with strength.
“You have what our colleges cannot give, the
courage to face yourself, the power to think.
And now all your past experiences are so much
capital to be utilized. Do you see the turning-point
I mean?”</p>

<p>“The turning-point in my life is to know I
got a friend. I owe it to the world to do something,
to be something, after this miracle of your
kindness.” And at his deepening smile, “But
you are not kind in a leaning-down sort of kindness.
You got none of that what-can-I-do-for-you-my-poor-child-look
in you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>Her effusiveness embarrassed him.</p>

<p>“You make too much out of nothing.”</p>

<p>“Nothing?” Her eyes were misty with
emotion. “I was something wild up in the air,
and I couldn’t get hold of myself all alone, and
you—you made me for a person.”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you how it affects me that in
some way I do not understand I have been the
means of bringing release to you. Of course,”
he added quickly, “I was only an instrument,
not a cause. Just as a spade which digs the
ground is not a cause of the fertility of the soil
or of the lovely flowers which spring forth. I
cannot get away from the poetic, the religious
experience which has so unexpectedly overtaken
me.”</p>

<p>She listened to him in silent wonder. How
different he was from the college people she had
met at luncheon that day!</p>

<p>“I can’t put it in words,” she fumbled, “but
I owe it to you, this confession. I can’t help it.
I used to hate so the educated! ‘Why should
they know everything, and me nothing?’ it cried
in me. ‘Here I’m dying to learn, to be something,
and they holding tight all the learning like
misers hiding gold.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>


<h3>§ 7</h3>

<p>President Irvine did not answer. After a
while he began talking in his calm voice of his
dream of democracy in education, of the plans
under way for the founding of the new school.</p>

<p>“I see it all!” She leaped to her feet under
the inspiration of his words. “This new school
is not to be only for the higher-ups by the higher-ups.
It’s to be for everybody—the tailor and the
fish-pedlar and the butcher. And the teachers
are not to be professors, talking to us down from
their heads, but living people, talking out of their
hearts. It’s to be what there never yet was in
this country—a school for the people.”</p>

<p>President Irvine had the sensation of being
swept out of himself upon strange, sunlit shores.
The bleak land of merely intellectual perception
lay behind him. Her ardour, her earnestness
broke through the habitual restraint of the Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>“Let me read you part of my lecture on the
new school,” he said, the contagion of her enthusiasm
vibrant in his low voice. “Teachers,
above all others, have occasion to be distressed
when the earlier idealism of welcome to the
oppressed is treated as a weak sentimentalism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
when sympathy for the unfortunate and those
who have not had a fair chance is regarded as
a weak indulgence fatal to efficiency. The new
school must aim to make up to the disinherited
masses by conscious instruction, by the development
of personal power for the loss of external
opportunities consequent upon the passing of our
pioneer days. Otherwise, power is likely to pass
more and more into the hands of the wealthy,
and we shall end with the same alliance between
intellectual and artistic culture and economic
power due to riches which has been the curse
of every civilization in the past, and which our
fathers in their democratic idealism thought this
nation was to put an end to.”</p>

<p>“Grand!” she cried, clapping her hands
ecstatically. “Your language is a little too high
over my head for me to understand what you’re
talking about, but I feel I know what you mean
to say. You mean, in the new school, America
is to be America, after all.” Eyes tense, brilliant,
held his. “I’ll give you an advice,” she went
on. “Translate your lecture in plain words like
they translate things from Russian into English,
or English into Russian. If you want your new
school to be for the people, so you got to begin
by talking in the plain words of the people. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
got to feel out your thoughts from the heart and
not from the head.”</p>

<p>Her words were like bullets that shot through
the static security of his traditional past.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can learn from you how to be
simple.”</p>

<p>“Sure! I feel I can learn you how to put
flesh and blood into your words so that everybody
can feel your thoughts close to the heart.”
The gesticulating hands swam before him like
waves of living flame. “Stand before your eyes
the people, the dumb, hungry people—hungry
for knowledge. You got that knowledge. And
when you talk in that high-headed lecture
language, it’s like you threw stones to those who
are hungry for bread.”</p>

<p>Then they were both silent, lost in their
thoughts. There was a new light in her eyes,
new strength in her arms and fingers, when she
rose to go.</p>

<p>“I shall never see the America which is to
be,” he said as he took her hand in parting; “it
will not come in my day. But I have seen its
soul like a free wild bird, beating its wings not
against bars, but against the skies that the light
might come through and reveal the earth to be.”</p>

<p>She walked down the corridor and out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
building still under the spell of his presence.
“Like a free wild bird! like a free wild bird!”
sang in her heart.</p>

<p>She had nearly reached home when she
became aware that tears were running down her
cheeks, but they were tears of a soul filled to the
brim—tears of vision and revelation. The glow
of the setting sun illuminated the whole earth.
She saw the soul beneath the starved, penny-pinched
faces of the Ghetto. The raucous voices
of the hucksters, the haggling women, the shrill
cries of the children—all seemed to blend and
fuse into one song of new dawn, of hope, of
faith fulfilled.</p>

<p>“After all,” she breathed in prayerful gratitude,
“it is ‘to the stars through difficulties.’ A
<i>meshugeneh</i> like me, a cook from Rosinsky’s
Restaurant burning her way up to the president
for a friend!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AN_IMMIGRANT_AMONG_THE">AN IMMIGRANT AMONG THE
EDITORS</h2>
</div>


<p>Ever since I began to read the American
magazines one burning question has consumed
me: why is it that only the thoughts of
educated people are written up? Why shouldn’t
sometimes a servant girl or a janitress or a coal-heaver
give his thoughts to the world? We who
are forced to do the drudgery of the world, and
who are considered ignorant because we have no
time for school, could say a lot of new and different
things, if only we had a chance to get a
hearing.</p>

<p>Very rarely I’d come across a story about a
shop-girl or a washerwoman. But they weren’t
real stories. They were twisted pictures of the
way the higher-ups see us people. They weren’t
as we are. They were as unreal as the knowledge
of the rich about the poor. Often I’d
read those smooth-flowing stories about nothing
at all, and I’d ask myself: why is it that so
many of the educated, with nothing to say, know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
how to say that nothing with such an easy flow
of words, while I, with something so aching to
be said, can say nothing?</p>

<p>I was like a prison world full of choked-in
voices, all beating in my brain to be heard. The
minute I’d listen to one voice a million other
voices would rush in crying for a hearing, till I’d
get too excited and mixed up to know what or
where.</p>

<p>Sometimes I’d see my brain as a sort of
Hester Street junk-shop, where a million different
things—rich up-town silks and velvets and the
cheapest kind of rags—were thrown around in
bunches. It seemed to me if I struggled from
morning till night all my years I could never put
order in my junk-shop brain.</p>

<p>Ach! If I only had an education, I used to
think. It seemed to me that educated people
were those who had their hearts and their heads
so settled down in order that they could go on
with quiet stillness to do anything they set out
to do. They could take up one thought, one
feeling at a time without getting the rest of themselves
mixed up and excited over it. They had
each thought, each feeling, laid out in separate
shelves in their heads. So they could draw out
one shelf of ideas while the rest of their ideas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
remained quiet and still in the orderly place
inside of them.</p>

<p>With me my thoughts were not up in my
head. They were in my hands and feet, in the
thinnest nerves of my hair, in the flesh and blood
of my whole body. Everything hurt in me when
I tried to think; it was like struggling up towards
something over me that I could never reach—like
tearing myself out inch by inch from the
roots of the earth—like suffering all pain of
dying and being born.</p>

<p>And when I’d really work out a thought in
words, I’d want to say it over and over a million
times, for fear maybe I wasn’t saying it strong
enough. And I’d clutch at my few little words
as a starving man clutches at crumbs. I could
never sit back with the feeling that I had said
what I wanted to say, like the educated people,
who are sure of themselves when they say something.
The real thing I meant remained inside
of me for want of deeper, more burning words
than I had yet found in the cold English
language.</p>

<p>With all the confused unsureness of myself,
I was absolutely sure I had great things in me.
I felt that all I needed was the chance to reach
the educated higher-ups, and all the big things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
in me would leap out quicker than lightning.
But how was I to reach these American-born
higher-ups when they were so much above me?
I could never get into their colleges because I
could never take the time to learn all the beginnings
from school to pass their entrance examinations.
And even if I had the time to study, I
wasn’t interested in grammar and arithmetic and
dry history and still drier and deader literature
about Chaucer and Marlowe. I was too much
on fire trying to think out my own thoughts to
get interested in the dust and ashes of dead and
gone ones. And yet I was so crazy to reach
those who had all that book-learning from school
in their heads that I was always dreaming of the
wonderful educated world that was over me.</p>

<p>Sometimes I’d wake up in the middle of the
night and stare through the darkness at an
imaginary world of educated people that would
invite me in to share with them their feast of
learning. I saw them sitting around a table
talking high thoughts, all the wisdom of the ages
flowing from lip to lip like living light. I saw
just how they talked and how they looked,
because once I had worked as a waitress in a
professor’s house. Their words were over my
head, but the sound of their low voices went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
through me like music of all that I longed and
dreamed and desired to be.</p>

<p>I used to hold myself tight-in, like a wooden
dummy, when I passed them the food. My lips
were tight together, my eyes half-closed, like a
Chinaman’s, as though I didn’t see or hear anything
but my one business of waiting on them.
But all the time something in the choked stillness
of me was crying out to them: “I’m no
dummy of a servant. I want to be like you. I
could be like all of you if I only had a chance.”</p>

<p>“If I only had a chance” kept going round
and round in my head.</p>

<p>“Make your chance,” a still voice goaded
me.</p>

<p>“If I could only write out my wonderful
thoughts that fly away in the air I’d get myself
a first place in America.”</p>

<p>“No, go ahead. Think connectedly for one
minute. Catch your crazy wild birds and bring
them down to earth.”</p>

<p>And so I pushed myself on to begin the
adventure of writing out my thoughts.</p>

<p>But who’ll print what I write? was my next
bother.</p>

<p>In my evenings off I used to go to the library
and kept looking and looking through all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
magazines to see where I could get a start. At
last I picked out three magazines that stood out
plainly for their special interest in working
people. I will call them <i>The Reformer</i>, <i>The
People</i> and <i>Free Mankind</i>.</p>

<p><i>Free Mankind</i> was a thin, white, educated-looking
magazine, without covers, without
pictures, without any advertising. It gave me
the feeling when I looked through the pages
that it was a head without a body. Most of the
articles were high words in the air. I couldn’t
make out what they were talking about, but some
of the editorials talked against paying rent.
This at once got me on fire with interest, because
all my life the people I knew were wearing out
their years worrying for the rent. If this magazine
was trying to put the landlords out of business,
I was with it. So, fired by the inspiration
of the moment, I rushed to see the editor of <i>Free
Mankind</i>.</p>

<p>I don’t remember how I ever pushed myself
past the telephone girl and secretary, but I found
myself talking face to face with a clean, cold,
high-thinking head, Mr. Alfred Nott, editor-boss
of <i>Free Mankind</i>. My burning enthusiasm
turned into ice through all my bones as I looked
into the terrible, clean face and cold eyes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
this clean cold higher-up. But I heard my words
rushing right to him like the words of a soap-box
speaker who is so on fire with his thoughts that
even the cold ones from up-town are forced to
listen to him.</p>

<p>“I can put a lot of new life into your magazine,”
I said. “I have in me great new ideas
about life, and I’m crazy to give them out to you.
Your magazine is too much up in the head and
not enough down on earth. It’s all words, words,
long-winded empty words in emptiness. Your
articles are something like those long sermons
about nothing, that put people to sleep. I can
wake up your readers like lightning. I can make
your magazine mean living things to living
people.”</p>

<p>The man fell back in his chair as if frightened.
His mouth opened to speak, but no words came
from his lips.</p>

<p>“What you tell us about not paying rent is
good enough,” I went on. “But you should tell
us how to put an end to all that. I know enough
about not having a place to sleep in to write you
something that will wake up the dead. You’re
not excited enough with feelings when you write,
because you live in a soft steam-heated place
with plenty of money to pay for it. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
poor like me, with little rent, and drying out
their heads worrying for that little, they feel
what it is to be under the foot of those Cossacks,
the landlords. In my stories I’d write for you,
I’d get the readers so mad, they’d rush out and
do something.”</p>

<p>Even while I was yet talking, Mr. Nott
slipped out of the chair and disappeared like a
frightened rabbit. I could see him vanishing
through the door before I could stop my flow
of words. I looked about me in the empty room.
I felt as if I’d been slapped in the face.</p>

<p>I ran out of the office with tears in my eyes.
And I couldn’t stop my crying in the street. So
this is his Free Mankind! When a person comes
to him with something real he runs away as from
a madman. Here was a paper that would reform
the world, and its boss wouldn’t even listen to
one of the people he was setting out to save.</p>

<p>But there were other magazines in America,
I told myself. <i>The Reformer</i> flashed before
my eyes, because I remember it said on the back
page, “It speaks for the average man.”</p>

<p>I found myself again face to face with an
editor—John Blair, the great liberal, the friend
of an American President, the starter of a new
school that was to gather all the minds of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
new world. With this man I thought I’d
begin by asking him a question instead of
rushing myself out to him in all my hungry
eagerness.</p>

<p>“Mr. Blair,” I demanded in a voice of
choked-in quietness, “do you think that the
educated people know it all?”</p>

<p>He looked at me for a long minute. His
lips closed together, his eyes cool like a judge.
I felt he looked me over to decide in what shelf
I belonged in the filing bureau of his college
head.</p>

<p>“No, my dear young woman. I don’t say
that educated people have a monopoly of knowledge,
but they are the only ones that know how
to use it.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s only the thoughts of educated
people for your magazine,” I cried disappointedly.
“How about people like me with a
lot to say but can’t put it in fancy language?
Isn’t your new school to be different from the
old colleges in that you want to bring out the
new thoughts of new people like me? Wouldn’t
you want to give a person like me a chance in
your magazine?”</p>

<p>“But can you express yourself logically,
reasonably?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“Logic—reason! Reason—logic!” I
jumped from the chair with excitement.
“That’s why your magazine is so dull, so dead,
because all your living thoughts die down in
the ashes of dead logic. Reason and logic
aren’t life. Hunger and desire are life. I know,
because I’m burning up with it. With this
hunger they paint pictures and write books and
sing songs——”</p>

<p>“You Russians are full of interesting stuff.
But you’re so incoherent. You’d be no use to
us unless you could learn to think clearly.”</p>

<p>“I know my thoughts are all mixed up,” I
pleaded with educated quietness, “but it’s only
because I have so much to give and nobody wants
it. Wouldn’t it be better for your magazine to
have my mixed-up aliveness instead of the cold
logic from your college writers?”</p>

<p>He smiled down pityingly on me.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that such a chaotic mind as
yours would be useless to an intellectual journal.
Good day.”</p>

<p>Not crushed, but bitter and hard and with head
high, I walked out of <i>The Reformer</i> office. Were
all the magazines that set themselves up to save
the world headed by such narrow-thinking tsars?
Only to prove that all of them were run by some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
clique of college professors, I went to the office of
<i>The People</i>.</p>

<p>Here the editor didn’t run from me like a
frightened rabbit or sting me with logic like John
Blair. He cut short the interview by going over
to the shelf and taking down a book which he
handed to me with pitying kindness. “This will
help you to think and maybe to write.”</p>

<p>Out in the street, I gave a look at the book.
It was Genung’s “Psychology of Madness.” It
grew black and red before my eyes. So it’s madness
to want to give out my thoughts to the
world? They turn me down like a crazy beggar
only because I come to give them new ideas.</p>

<p>I threw the book away in the nearest ash can.
But that word “madness” was to me like a red
rag to a bull. I had to write now or go crazy with
the wrath these reformers roused in me.</p>

<p>“What’s my place in America?” I asked
myself. “Must I remain a choked-in servant in
somebody’s kitchen or somebody’s factory, or
will I find a way to give out my thoughts to
America?”</p>

<p>So what I wrote was the story of myself—myself
lost in America.</p>

<p>It was like new air in my lungs to let myself
loose on paper. But how could I get it to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
American people? One thing I was sure of. I
wasn’t going to subject myself to another insult
from those reform magazines. I don’t know how
it happened, but I picked out <i>Wharton’s Magazine</i>,
the most literary magazine of all those I
looked over, simply because it looked so solidly
high above the rest. My desperate need for a
hearing made me bold. In my ragged coat and
torn shoes I walked into that breath-taking rich
office like a millionaire landlord with pockets full
of rent money.</p>

<p>“Do you want something new and different
for your magazine?” I asked with the low voice
and the high head of an American-born.</p>

<p>Friendly eyes turned on me. “We’re always
seeking something new and different. Have you
got it?”</p>

<p>I looked right into the friendly eyes. This
was Mr. Robert Reeves, the editor. He had the
clean, well-dressed look of the born higher-up.
But how different from those others! His face
was human. And there was a shine in the eyes
that warmed me.</p>

<p>“I’m an immigrant,” I said. “I have worked
in kitchens, factories and sweatshops. I’m dying
away with the loneliness of my thoughts, so I
wrote myself out in a story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>He snatched up the papers and began to read.
A quick light flashed into his eyes. Then he
turned to me.</p>

<p>“I can see you have something original. But
I can’t decide just now. You’ll hear from me as
soon as I have read it through.”</p>

<p>I could hardly walk the street for excitement.
My life hung on this man’s answer. And it came
two days later in a small envelope. He offered
me two hundred dollars for my story.</p>

<p>I couldn’t believe it wasn’t a dream. And I
rushed with the letter to his office. “You could
have given me a hundred dollars, fifty, twenty-five,
and it would have been to me a fortune.
But two hundred—do you mean really to give
that much to me?”</p>

<p>He chuckled to himself, and I rushed right
on. “I thought New York was a den of thieves.
The landlord robbing you with the rent, and the
restaurants cheating the strength out of every
bite of food you buy. And I thought the college
higher-ups were only educated cowards with dish-water
in their veins, scared to death of hungry
people like me, scared to look at the face of
suffering. Their logic and their reason—only
how to use their book-learning brains to shut out
their hearts—to make themselves deaf, dumb and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
blind to the cry of hunger and want knocking at
their doors.”</p>

<p>“Just because you felt all that so deeply you
were able to put fire in your words.”</p>

<p>A thousand windows of light burst open in
me as I listened to him. I was like something
choked for ages in the tight chains of ignorance
and fear, breathing the first breath of free air.
For the first time my eyes began to see, my ears
began to hear, my heart began to understand the
world’s wonder and the beauty.</p>

<p>A great pity welled up in my heart for the
Alfred Notts and the John Blairs whom I had
so mercilessly condemned. Poor little-educated
ones! Why did I fear them and envy them and
hate them so for nothing? They were only little
children putting on a long wooden face, playing
teacher to the world. And I was a little scared
child afraid of teacher—afraid they were grown-ups
with the power to hurt me and shut me out
from the fun of life.</p>

<p>Why wasn’t I scared of Robert Reeves from
the first minute? It was because he didn’t
frighten people with his highness. He didn’t
wear a wooden face of dignity. He was no
reformer, no holy social worker—only a human
being who loved people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>That one flash of understanding from Robert
Reeves filled me with such enthusiasm for work
that I shut myself off from the rest of the world
and began turning out story after story.</p>

<p>Years passed. The only sign of success I
became aware of was the increasing flood of mail
that poured in on me. People who wanted to be
writers asked me for literary help. People who
imagined I was rolling in money sent me begging
letters for aid. At the beginning I wanted to
help them all. But I soon saw that I’d have to
spend all my time answering the demands of
foolish self-seekers who had nothing in common
with me. And so I had to harden my heart
against these time-wasting intruders.</p>

<p>One day, as I walked out of my house
absorbed in one of the characters that I was
writing about, someone stopped me. I looked
up. A pale, thin, hungry-eyed young man asked
timidly: “May I speak to you for a minute?”
Then he told me that he had written a book, and
that the publishers had turned it down, so he
had printed it himself. “And I want your
opinion,” he pleaded, “because none of the
critics would listen to me.”</p>

<p>“I’m too busy,” I said irritably. “If you had
to print the book yourself it means it’s no good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“I thought you, who once had such a hard
struggle, would remember—would understand.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to understand except that
you killed yourself with the public.” And I
walked off.</p>

<p>I tried to resume the trend of my thoughts,
but I could not think. The pale face, the hungry
eyes, followed me accusingly in the street. “You
who once struggled would understand” rang in
my ears. And suddenly I realized how brutal I
had been.</p>

<p>“But it’s the merciless truth,” I defended.
Nobody could help him till he finds himself.
Nobody helped me till I had found myself.</p>

<p>“No, I’m all wrong,” another voice cried.
“Robert Reeves helped me. I could never have
helped myself all alone. You can only help
yourself half the way. The other half is some
Hand of God in the shape of a human contact.”</p>

<p>Something hurt so deep in me I couldn’t work
that day. I couldn’t sleep that night. The pale
face and the hungry eyes kept staring at me
through the darkness. I, who judged the Alfred
Notts and the John Blairs—I saw myself condemned
as one of them. I had let myself get so
absorbed with the thoughts in my head that I
ceased to have a heart for the people about me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>What would I not have given to see that
young man and tell him how I suffered for my
inhuman busy-business, which had shut my eyes
to the hungry hands reaching up to me. But I
never saw him again. And yet that man whom
I had turned away like a beggar had brought me
the life of a new awakening. He had made me
aware that I could never contribute my deepest
to America if I lost the friendly understanding
of humanity that Robert Reeves had given me,
if I lost the one precious thing that makes life
real—the love for people, even if they are lost,
wandering, crazy people.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AMERICA_AND_I">AMERICA AND I</h2>
</div>


<p>As one of the dumb, voiceless ones I speak.
One of the millions of immigrants beating,
beating out their hearts at your gates for a breath
of understanding.</p>

<p>Ach! America! From the other end of the
earth from where I came, America was a land of
living hope, woven of dreams, aflame with longing
and desire.</p>

<p>Choked for ages in the airless oppression of
Russia, the Promised Land rose up—wings for
my stifled spirit—sunlight burning through my
darkness—freedom singing to me in my prison—deathless
songs tuning prison bars into strings
of a beautiful violin.</p>

<p>I arrived in America. My young, strong body,
my heart and soul pregnant with the unlived lives
of generations clamouring for expression.</p>

<p>What my mother and father and their mother
and father never had a chance to give out in
Russia, I would give out in America. The hidden
sap of centuries would find release; colours that
never saw light—songs that died unvoiced—romance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
that never had a chance to blossom in
the black life of the Old World.</p>

<p>In the golden land of flowing opportunity I
was to find my work that was denied me in the
sterile village of my forefathers. Here I was to
be free from the dead drudgery for bread that
held me down in Russia. For the first time in
America I’d cease to be a slave of the belly. I’d
be a creator, a giver, a human being! My work
would be the living joy of fullest self-expression.</p>

<p>But from my high visions, my golden hopes,
I had to put my feet down on earth. I had to
have food and shelter. I had to have the money
to pay for it.</p>

<p>I was in America, among the Americans, but
not of them. No speech, no common language,
no way to win a smile of understanding from
them, only my young, strong body and my untried
faith. Only my eager, empty hands, and my full
heart shining from my eyes!</p>

<p>God from the world! Here I was with so
much richness in me, but my mind was not wanted
without the language. And my body, unskilled,
untrained, was not even wanted in the factory.
Only one of two chances was left open to me:
the kitchen, or minding babies.</p>

<p>My first job was as a servant in an Americanized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
family. Once, long ago, they came from
the same village from where I came. But they
were so well dressed, so well fed, so successful in
America, that they were ashamed to remember
their mother tongue.</p>

<p>“What were to be my wages?” I ventured
timidly, as I looked up to the well-fed, well-dressed
“American” man and woman.</p>

<p>They looked at me with a sudden coldness.
What have I said to draw away from me their
warmth? Was it so low from me to talk of
wages? I shrank back into myself like a low-down
bargainer. Maybe they’re so high up in
well-being they can’t any more understand my
low thoughts for money.</p>

<p>From his rich height the man preached down
to me that I must not be so grabbing for wages.
Only just landed from the ship and already
thinking about money when I should be thankful
to associate with “Americans.”</p>

<p>The woman, out of her smooth, smiling fatness,
assured me that this was my chance for a
summer vacation in the country with her two
lovely children. My great chance to learn to
be a civilized being, to become an American by
living with them.</p>

<p>So, made to feel that I was in the hands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
American friends, invited to share with them their
home, their plenty, their happiness, I pushed out
from my head the worry for wages. Here was
my first chance to begin my life in the sunshine
after my long darkness. My laugh was all over
my face as I said to them: “I’ll trust myself to
you. What I’m worth you’ll give me.” And I
entered their house like a child by the hand.</p>

<p>The best of me I gave them. Their house
cares were my house cares. I got up early. I
worked till late. All that my soul hungered to
give I put into the passion with which I scrubbed
floors, scoured pots, and washed clothes. I was
so grateful to mingle with the American people,
to hear the music of the American language, that
I never knew tiredness.</p>

<p>There was such a freshness in my brains and
such a willingness in my heart that I could go
on and on—not only with the work of the house,
but work with my head—learning new words from
the children, the grocer, the butcher, the iceman.
I was not even afraid to ask for words from the
policeman on the street. And every new word
made me see new American things with American
eyes. I felt like a Columbus, finding new worlds
through every new word.</p>

<p>But words alone were only for the inside of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
me. The outside of me still branded me for a
steerage immigrant. I had to have clothes to
forget myself that I’m a stranger yet. And so
I had to have money to buy these clothes.</p>

<p>The month was up. I was so happy! Now
I’d have money. <i>My own, earned</i> money.
Money to buy a new shirt on my back, shoes on
my feet. Maybe yet an American dress and hat!</p>

<p>Ach! How high rose my dreams! How
plainly I saw all that I would do with my
visionary wages shining like a light over my
head!</p>

<p>In my imagination I already walked in my
new American clothes. How beautiful I looked
as I saw myself like a picture before my eyes!
I saw how I would throw away my immigrant rags
tied up in my immigrant shawl. With money to
buy—free money in my hands—I’d show them
that I could look like an American in a day.</p>

<p>Like a prisoner in his last night in prison,
counting the seconds that will free him from his
chains, I trembled breathlessly for the minute I’d
get the wages in my hand.</p>

<p>Before dawn I rose.</p>

<p>I shined up the house like a jewel-box.</p>

<p>I prepared breakfast and waited with my heart
in my mouth for my lady and gentleman to rise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
At last I heard them stirring. My eyes were
jumping out of my head to them when I saw them
coming in and seating themselves by the table.</p>

<p>Like a hungry cat rubbing up to its boss for
meat, so I edged and simpered around them as
I passed them the food. Without my will, like
a beggar, my hand reached out to them.</p>

<p>The breakfast was over. And no word yet
from my wages.</p>

<p>“Gottuniu!” I thought to myself. “Maybe
they’re so busy with their own things they forgot
it’s the day for my wages. Could they who have
everything know what I was to do with my first
American dollars? How could they, soaking in
plenty, how could they feel the longing and the
fierce hunger in me, pressing up through each
visionary dollar? How could they know the
gnawing ache of my avid fingers for the feel of
my own, earned dollars? <i>My</i> dollars that I could
spend like a free person. <i>My</i> dollars that would
make me feel with everybody alike!”</p>

<p>Breakfast was long past.</p>

<p>Lunch came. Lunch past.</p>

<p>Oi-i weh! Not a word yet about my money.</p>

<p>It was near dinner. And not a word yet
about my wages.</p>

<p>I began to set the table. But my head—it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
swam away from me. I broke a glass. The silver
dropped from my nervous fingers. I couldn’t
stand it any longer. I dropped everything and
rushed over to my American lady and gentleman.</p>

<p>“Oi weh! The money—my money—my
wages!” I cried breathlessly.</p>

<p>Four cold eyes turned on me.</p>

<p>“Wages? Money?” The four eyes turned
into hard stone as they looked me up and down.
“Haven’t you a comfortable bed to sleep, and
three good meals a day? You’re only a month
here. Just came to America. And you already
think about money. Wait till you’re worth any
money. What use are you without knowing
English? You should be glad we keep you here.
It’s like a vacation for you. Other girls pay
money yet to be in the country.”</p>

<p>It went black for my eyes. I was so choked
no words came to my lips. Even the tears went
dry in my throat.</p>

<p>I left. Not a dollar for all my work!</p>

<p>For a long, long time my heart ached and
ached like a sore wound. If murderers would
have robbed me and killed me it wouldn’t have
hurt me so much. I couldn’t think through my
pain. The minute I’d see before me how they
looked at me, the words they said to me—then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
everything began to bleed in me. And I was
helpless.</p>

<p>For a long, long time the thought of ever
working in an “American” family made me
tremble with fear, like the fear of wild wolves.
No—never again would I trust myself to an
“American” family, no matter how fine their
language and how sweet their smile.</p>

<p>It was blotted out in me, all trust in friendship
from “Americans.” But the life in me still
burned to live. The hope in me still craved to
hope. In darkness, in dirt, in hunger and want,
but only to live on!</p>

<p>There had been no end to my day—working
for the “American” family.</p>

<p>Now rejecting false friendships from higher-ups
in America, I turned back to the ghetto. I
worked on a hard bench with my own kind on
either side of me. I knew before I began what
my wages were to be. I knew what my hours
were to be. And I knew the feeling of the end
of the day.</p>

<p>From the outside my second job seemed
worse than the first. It was in a sweat-shop of
a Delancey Street basement, kept up by an old,
wrinkled woman that looked like a black witch
of greed. My work was sewing on buttons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
While the morning was still dark I walked into
a dark basement. And darkness met me when
I turned out of the basement.</p>

<p>Day after day, week after week, all the contact
I got with America was handling dead
buttons. The money I earned was hardly
enough to pay for bread and rent. I didn’t
have a room to myself. I didn’t even have a
bed. I slept on a mattress on the floor in a
rat-hole of a room occupied by a dozen other
immigrants. I was always hungry—oh, so
hungry! The scant meals I could afford only
sharpened my appetite for real food. But I felt
myself better off than working in the “American”
family, where I had three good meals a
day and a bed to myself. With all the hunger
and darkness of the sweat-shop, I had at least
the evening to myself. And all night was mine.
When all were asleep, I used to creep up on the
roof of the tenement and talk out my heart in
silence to the stars in the sky.</p>

<p>“Who am I? What am I? What do I
want with my life? Where is America? Is
there an America? What is this wilderness in
which I’m lost?”</p>

<p>I’d hurl my questions and then think and
think. And I could not tear it out of me, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
feeling that America must be somewhere, somehow—only
I couldn’t find it—<i>my America</i>, where
I would work for love and not for a living. I
was like a thing following blindly after something
far off in the dark!</p>

<p>“Oi weh!” I’d stretch out my hand up in
the air. “My head is so lost in America!
What’s the use of all my working if I’m not in
it? Dead buttons is not me.”</p>

<p>Then the busy season started in the shop.
The mounds of buttons grew and grew. The
long day stretched out longer. I had to begin
with the buttons earlier and stay with them till
later in the night. The old witch turned into a
huge greedy maw for wanting more and more
buttons.</p>

<p>For a glass of tea, for a slice of herring over
black bread, she would buy us up to stay another
and another hour, till there seemed no end to
her demands.</p>

<p>One day, the light of self-assertion broke into
my cellar darkness.</p>

<p>“I don’t want the tea. I don’t want your
herring,” I said with terrible boldness. “I only
want to go home. I only want the evening to
myself!”</p>

<p>“You fresh mouth, you!” cried the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
witch. “You learned already too much in
America. I want no clock-watchers in my shop.
Out you go!”</p>

<p>I was driven out to cold and hunger. I
could no longer pay for my mattress on the floor.
I no longer could buy the bite in the mouth. I
walked the streets. I knew what it is to be
alone in a strange city among strangers.</p>

<p>But I laughed through my tears. So I learned
too much already in America because I wanted
the whole evening to myself? Well, America
has yet to teach me still more: how to get not
only the whole evening to myself, but a whole
day a week like the American workers.</p>

<p>That sweat-shop was a bitter memory but a
good school. It fitted me for a regular factory.
I could walk in boldly and say I could work at
something, even if it was only sewing on buttons.</p>

<p>Gradually, I became a trained worker. I
worked in a light, airy factory, only eight hours
a day. My boss was no longer a sweater and
a blood-squeezer. The first freshness of the
morning was mine. And the whole evening was
mine. All day Sunday was mine.</p>

<p>Now I had better food to eat. I slept on a
better bed. Now, I even looked dressed up like
the American-born. But inside of me I knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
that I was not yet an American. I choked with
longing when I met an American-born, and I
couldn’t say nothing.</p>

<p>Something cried dumb in me. I couldn’t
help it. I didn’t know what it was I wanted.
I only knew I wanted. I wanted. Like the
hunger in the heart that never gets food.</p>

<p>An English class for foreigners started in our
factory. The teacher had such a good, friendly
face, her eyes looked so understanding, as
though she could see right into my heart. So
I went to her one day for an advice:</p>

<p>“I don’t know what is with me the matter,”
I began. “I have no rest in me. I never yet
done what I want.”</p>

<p>“What is it you want to do, child?” she
asked me.</p>

<p>“I want to do something with my head, my
feelings. All day long, only with my hands I
work.”</p>

<p>“First you must learn English.” She patted
me as though I was not yet grown up. “Put
your mind on that, and then we’ll see.”</p>

<p>So for a time I learned the language. I
could almost begin to think with English words
in my head. But in my heart still hurt the emptiness.
I burned to give, to give something, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
do something, to be something. The dead work
with my hands was killing me. My work left
only hard stones on my heart.</p>

<p>Again I went to our factory teacher and cried
out to her: “I know already to read and write
the English language, but I can’t put it into
words what I want. What is it in me so different
that can’t come out?”</p>

<p>She smiled at me down from her calmness as
if I were a little bit out of my head. “What
<i>do you want</i> to do?”</p>

<p>“I feel. I see. I hear. And I want to
think it out. But I’m like dumb in me. I only
feel I’m different—different from everybody.”</p>

<p>She looked at me close and said nothing
for a minute. “You ought to join one of the
social clubs of the Women’s Association,” she
advised.</p>

<p>“What’s the Women’s Association?” I
implored greedily.</p>

<p>“A group of American women who are trying
to help the working-girl find herself. They
have a special department for immigrant girls
like you.”</p>

<p>I joined the Women’s Association. On my
first evening there they announced a lecture:
“The Happy Worker and His Work,” by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
Welfare director of the United Mills Corporation.</p>

<p>“Is there such a thing as a happy worker
at his work?” I wondered. “Happiness is only
by working at what you love. And what poor girl
can ever find it to work at what she loves?” My
old dreams about my America rushed through my
mind. Once I thought that in America everybody
works for love. Nobody has to worry for
a living. Maybe this welfare man came to show
me the <i>real</i> America that till now I sought in
vain.</p>

<p>With a lot of polite words the head lady of
the Women’s Association introduced a higher-up
that looked like the king of kings of business.
Never before in my life did I ever see a man
with such a sureness in his step, such power in
his face, such friendly positiveness in his eye as
when he smiled upon us.</p>

<p>“Efficiency is the new religion of business,”
he began. “In big business houses, even in
up-to-date factories, they no longer take the first
comer and give him any job that happens to
stand empty. Efficiency begins at the employment
office. Experts are hired for the one purpose,
to find out how best to fit the worker to
his work. It’s economy for the boss to make the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
worker happy.” And then he talked a lot more
on efficiency in educated language that was over
my head.</p>

<p>I didn’t know exactly what it meant—efficiency—but
if it was to make the worker happy
at his work, then that’s what I had been looking
for since I came to America. I only felt from
watching him that he was happy by his job.
And as I looked on this clean, well-dressed,
successful one, who wasn’t ashamed to say he
rose from an office-boy, it made me feel that I,
too, could lift myself up for a person.</p>

<p>He finished his lecture, telling us about the
Vocational Guidance Centre that the Women’s
Association started.</p>

<p>The very next evening I was at the Vocational
Guidance Centre. There I found a
young, college-looking woman. Smartness and
health shining from her eyes! She, too, looked
as if she knew her way in America. I could tell
at the first glance: here is a person that is happy
by what she does.</p>

<p>“I feel you’ll understand me,” I said right
away.</p>

<p>She leaned over with pleasure in her face:
“I hope I can.”</p>

<p>“I want to work by what’s in me. Only, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
don’t know what’s in me. I only feel I’m
different.”</p>

<p>She gave me a quick, puzzled look from the
corner of her eyes. “What are you doing
now?”</p>

<p>“I’m the quickest shirtwaist hand on the floor.
But my heart wastes away by such work. I think
and think, and my thoughts can’t come out.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you think out your thoughts in
shirtwaists? You could learn to be a designer.
Earn more money.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to look on waists. If my
hands are sick from waists, how could my head
learn to put beauty into them?”</p>

<p>“But you must earn your living at what you
know, and rise slowly from job to job.”</p>

<p>I looked at her office sign: “Vocational
Guidance.” “What’s your vocational guidance?”
I asked. “How to rise from job to
job—how to earn more money?”</p>

<p>The smile went out from her eyes. But she
tried to be kind yet. “What <i>do</i> you want?”
she asked, with a sigh of lost patience.</p>

<p>“I want America to want me.”</p>

<p>She fell back in her chair, thunderstruck with
my boldness. But yet, in a low voice of educated
self-control, she tried to reason with me:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“You have to <i>show</i> that you have something
special for America before America has need of
you.”</p>

<p>“But I never had a chance to find out what’s
in me, because I always had to work for a living.
Only, I feel it’s efficiency for America to find out
what’s in me so different, so I could give it out
by my work.”</p>

<p>Her eyes half closed as they bored through
me. Her mouth opened to speak, but no words
came from her lips. So I flamed up with all
that was choking in me like a house on fire:</p>

<p>“America gives free bread and rent to
criminals in prison. They got grand houses,
with sunshine, fresh air, doctors and teachers,
even for the crazy ones. Why don’t they have
free boarding-schools for immigrants—strong
people—willing people? Here you see us burning
up with something different, and America
turns its head away from us.”</p>

<p>Her brows lifted and dropped down. She
shrugged her shoulders away from me with the
look of pity we give to cripples and hopeless
lunatics.</p>

<p>“America is no Utopia. First you must become
efficient in earning a living before you can
indulge in your poetic dreams.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>I went away from the vocational guidance
office with all the air out of my lungs. All the
light out of my eyes. My feet dragged after
me like dead wood.</p>

<p>Till now there had always lingered a rosy
veil of hope over my emptiness, a hope that a
miracle would happen. I would open up my
eyes some day and suddenly find the America
of my dreams. As a young girl hungry for love
sees always before her eyes the picture of
lover’s arms around her, so I saw always in my
heart the vision of Utopian America.</p>

<p>But now I felt that the America of my dreams
never was and never could be. Reality had hit
me on the head as with a club. I felt that the
America that I sought was nothing but a shadow—an
echo—a chimera of lunatics and crazy
immigrants.</p>

<p>Stripped of all illusion, I looked about me.
The long desert of wasting days of drudgery
stared me in the face. The drudgery that I
had lived through, and the endless drudgery still
ahead of me rose over me like a withering wilderness
of sand. In vain were all my cryings, in
vain were all frantic efforts of my spirit to find
the living waters of understanding for my perishing
lips. Sand, sand was everywhere. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
every seeking, every reaching out I only lost
myself deeper and deeper in a vast sea of sand.</p>

<p>I knew now the American language. And I
knew now, if I talked to the Americans from
morning till night, they could not understand
what the Russian soul of me wanted. They
could not understand <i>me</i> any more than if I
talked to them in Chinese. Between my soul
and the American soul were worlds of difference
that no words could bridge over. What was that
difference? What made the Americans so far
apart from me?</p>

<p>I began to read the American history. I
found from the first pages that America started
with a band of courageous Pilgrims. They had
left their native country as I had left mine.
They had crossed an unknown ocean and landed
in an unknown country, as I.</p>

<p>But the great difference between the first Pilgrims
and me was that they expected to make
America, build America, create their own world
of liberty. I wanted to find it ready-made.</p>

<p>I read on. I delved deeper down into the
American history. I saw how the Pilgrim
Fathers came to a rocky desert country, surrounded
by Indian savages on all sides. But
undaunted, they pressed on—through danger—through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
famine, pestilence, and want—they
pressed on. They did not ask the Indians for
sympathy, for understanding. They made no
demands on anybody, but on their own indomitable
spirit of persistence.</p>

<p>And I—I was for ever begging a crumb of
sympathy, a gleam of understanding from
strangers who could not sympathize, who could
not understand.</p>

<p>I, when I encountered a few savage Indian
scalpers, like the old witch of the sweat-shop,
like my “Americanized” countryman, who
cheated me of my wages—I, when I found myself
on the lonely, untrodden path through
which all seekers of the new world must pass, I
lost heart and said: “There is no America!”</p>

<p>Then came a light—a great revelation! I
saw America—a big idea—a deathless hope—a
world still in the making. I saw that it was the
glory of America that it was not yet finished.
And I, the last comer, had her share to give,
small or great, to the making of America, like
those Pilgrims who came in the <i>Mayflower</i>.</p>

<p>Fired up by this revealing light, I began to
build a bridge of understanding between the
American-born and myself. Since their life was
shut out from such as me, I began to open up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
my life and the lives of my people to them. And
life draws life. In only writing about the Ghetto
I found America.</p>

<p>Great chances have come to me. But in my
heart is always a deep sadness. I feel like a man
who is sitting down to a secret table of plenty,
while his near ones and dear ones are perishing
before his eyes. My very joy in doing the work
I love hurts me like secret guilt, because all about
me I see so many with my longings, my burning
eagerness, to do and to be, wasting their days in
drudgery they hate, merely to buy bread and pay
rent. And America is losing all that richness of
the soul.</p>

<p>The Americans of to-morrow, the America
that is every day nearer coming to be, will be
too wise, too open-hearted, too friendly-handed,
to let the least last-comer at their gates knock
in vain with his gifts unwanted.</p>

</div>


<p>A drizzling rain had begun to fall. I
was wet and chilled to the bone. I had
just left the free ward of a hospital, where I had
been taken when ill with the flu. It was good
to be home again! Even though what I called
home were but the dim, narrow halls of a lodging-house.
With a sigh of relief, I dropped my suitcase
in the vestibule.</p>

<p>As the door swung open, the landlady met me
with: “Your room is taken. Your things are in
the cellar.”</p>

<p>“My room?” I stammered, white with fear.</p>

<p>“Oh no—please, Mrs. Pelz!”</p>

<p>“I got a chance to rent your room at such a
good price, I couldn’t afford to hold it.”</p>

<p>“But you promised to keep it for me while I
was away. And I paid you for it——”</p>

<p>“The landlord raised me my rent and I got
to get it out from the roomers,” she defended.
“I got four hungry mouths to feed——”</p>

<p>“But maybe I would have paid you a little
more,” I pleaded. “If you had only told me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
I have to go back to work to-day. How can I
get another room at a moment’s notice?”</p>

<p>“We all got to look out for ourselves. I am
getting more than twice as much as you paid
me from this new lodger,” she finished triumphantly.
“And no housekeeping privileges.”</p>

<p>“You must give me time!” My voice rose
into a shriek. “You can’t put a girl out into
the street at a moment’s notice. There are laws
in America——”</p>

<p>“There are no laws for roomers.”</p>

<p>“No law for roomers?” All my weakness
and helplessness rushed out of me in a fury of
rebellion. “No law for roomers?”</p>

<p>“I could have put your things out in the
street when your week was up. But being you
were sick, I was kind enough to keep them in
the cellar. But your room is taken,” she said
with finality. “I got to let my rooms to them
as pay the most. I got to feed my own children
first. I can’t carry the whole world on my back.”</p>

<p>I tried to speak. But no voice came to my
lips. I felt struck with a club on the head. I
could only stare at her. And I must have been
staring for some time without seeing her, for I
had not noticed she had gone till I heard a voice
from the upper stairs, “Are you still here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“Oh—yes—yes—I—I—am—going—go-ing.”
I tried to rouse my stunned senses,
which seemed struck to the earth.</p>

<p>“There’s no money in letting rooms to
girls,” my landlady continued, as she came
down to open the door for me. “They’re always
cooking, or washing, or ironing and using out my
gas. This new roomer I never hear nor see except
in the morning when he goes to work and
at night when he comes to sleep.”</p>

<p>I staggered out in a bewildered daze. I
leaned against the cold iron lamp-post. It
seemed so kind, so warm. Even the chill,
drizzling rain beating on my face was almost
human. Slowly, my numbed brain began to
recollect where I was. Where should I turn?
To whom? I faced an endless maze of endless
streets. All about me strangers—seas of
jostling strangers. I was alone—shelterless!</p>

<p>All that I had suffered in lodging-houses
rushed over me. I had never really lived or
breathed like a free, human being. My closed
door assured me no privacy. I lived in constant
dread of any moment being pounced upon by
my landlady for daring to be alive. I dared not
hang out my clothes on a line in the fresh air.
I was forced to wash and dry them stealthily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
at night, over chairs and on my trunk. I was
under the same restraint when I did my simple
cooking although I paid dearly for the gas I
used.</p>

<p>This ceaseless strain of don’t move here and
don’t step there was far from my idea of home.
But still it was shelter from the streets. I had
almost become used to it. I had almost learned
not to be crushed by it. Now, I was shut out—kicked
out like a homeless dog.</p>

<p>All thought of reporting at my office left my
mind. I walked and walked, driven by despair.
Tears pressed in my throat, but my eyes were
dry as sand.</p>

<p>I tried to struggle out of my depression. I
looked through the furnished room sections of the
city. There were no cheap rooms to be had.
The prices asked for the few left were ten, twelve
and fifteen dollars a week.</p>

<p>I earn twenty-five dollars a week as a stenographer.
I am compelled to dress neatly to
hold down my job. And with clothes and food
so high, how could I possibly pay more than one-third
of my salary for rent?</p>

<p>In my darkness I saw a light—a vision of the
settlement. As an immigrant I had joined one
of the social clubs there, and I remembered there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
was a residence somewhere in that building for
the workers. Surely they would take me in till
I had found a place to live.</p>

<p>“I’m in such trouble!” I stammered, as I
entered the office of the head resident. “My
landlady put me out because I couldn’t pay the
raise in rent.”</p>

<p>“The housing problem is appalling,” Miss
Ward agreed with her usual professional friendliness.
“I wish I could let you stay with us,
my child, but our place is only for social
workers.”</p>

<p>“Where should I go?” I struggled to keep
back my tears. “I’m so terribly alone.”</p>

<p>“Now—now, dear child,” Miss Ward patted
my shoulder encouragingly. “You mustn’t give
way like that. Of course, I’ll give you the
addresses of mothers of our neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>One swift glance at the calm, well-fed face
and I felt instantly that Miss Ward had never
known the terror of homelessness.</p>

<p>“You know, dear, I want to help you all I
can,” smiled Miss Ward, trying to be kind, “and
I’m always glad when my girls come to me.”</p>

<p>“What was the use of my coming to you?”
I was in no mood for her make-believe settlement
smile. “If you don’t take me in, aren’t you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
pushing me in the street—joining hands with my
landlady?”</p>

<p>“Why—my dear!” The mask of smiling
kindness dropped from Miss Ward’s face. Her
voice cooled. “Surely you will find a room in
this long list of addresses I am giving you.”</p>

<p>I went to a dozen places. It was the same
everywhere. No rooms were to be had at the
price I could afford.</p>

<p>Crushed again and again, the habit of hope
still asserted itself. I suddenly remembered
there was one person from whom I was almost
sure of getting help—an American woman who
had befriended me while still an immigrant in
the factory. Her money had made it possible
for me to take up the stenographic course. Full
of renewed hope, I sped along the streets. My
buoyant faith ever expectant could think of one
outcome only.</p>

<p>Mrs. Olney had just finished dictating to her
secretary, when the maid ushered me into the
luxurious library.</p>

<p>“How good it is to see you! What can I
do for you?” The touch of Mrs. Olney’s fine
hand, the sound of her lovely voice was like the
warming breath of sunshine to a frozen thing. A
choking came in my throat. Tears blinded me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“If it wasn’t a case of life and death, I
wouldn’t have bothered you so early in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, my child?” Mrs. Olney
was all concern.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand it any longer! Get me a
place to live!” And I told her of my experiences
with my landlady and my hopeless room-hunting.</p>

<p>“I have many young friends who are in just
your plight,” Mrs. Olney consoled. “And I’m
sending them all to the Better Housing Bureau.”</p>

<p>I felt as though a powerful lamp went out
suddenly within my soul. A sharp chill seized
me. The chasm that divides those who have and
those who have not yawned between us. The
face I had loved and worshipped receded and
grew dim under my searching gaze.</p>

<p>Here was a childless woman with a houseful
of rooms to herself. Here was a philanthropist
who gave thousands of dollars to help the poor.
And here I tried to tell her that I was driven
out into the street—shelterless. And her answer
to my aching need was, “The Better Housing
Bureau.”</p>

<p>Again I turned to the unfeeling glare of the
streets. A terrible loneliness bled in my heart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
Such tearing, grinding pain was dragging me to
the earth! I could barely hold myself up on
my feet. “Ach! Only for a room to rest!”
And I staggered like a dizzy drunkard to the
Better Housing Bureau.</p>

<p>At the waiting-room I paused in breathless
admiration. The soft greys and blues of the
walls and hangings, the deep-seated divans, the
flowers scattered in effective profusion, soothed
and rested me like silent music. Even the
smoothly fitting gown of the housing specialist
seemed almost part of the colour scheme.</p>

<p>As I approached the mahogany desk I felt
shabby—uncomfortable in this flawless atmosphere,
but I managed somehow to tell of my
need. I had no sooner explained the kind of
room I could afford than the lady requested the
twenty-five cents registration fee.</p>

<p>“I want to see the room first,” I demanded.</p>

<p>“All our applicants pay in advance.”</p>

<p>“I have only a two-dollar bill, and I don’t
get my pay till Monday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right. I’ll change it,” she
offered obligingly. And she took my one
remaining bill.</p>

<p>“Where were you born? What is your
religion?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“I came for a room and not to be inquisitioned,”
I retorted.</p>

<p>“We are compelled to keep statistics of all
our applicants.”</p>

<p>Resentfully, I gave her the desired information,
and with the addresses she had given me
I recommenced my search. At the end of
another futile hour of room-hunting there was
added to the twenty-five cents registration fee
an expense of fifteen cents for car fare. And I
was still homeless.</p>

<p>I had been expecting to hear from my sister
who had married a prosperous merchant and
whom I hadn’t seen for years. In my agitation
I had forgotten to ask for my mail, and I went
back to see about it. A telegram had come,
stating my sister was staying at the Astor and I
was to meet her there for lunch.</p>

<p>I hastened to her. For although she was now
rich and comfortable, I felt that after all she
was my sister and she would help me out.</p>

<p>“How shabby you look!” She cast a disapproving
glance at me from head to foot.
“Couldn’t you dress decently to meet me, when
you knew I was staying at this fashionable
hotel?”</p>

<p>I told her of my plight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“Why not go to a hotel till you find a
suitable room?” she blandly advised.</p>

<p>My laughter sounded unreal so loud it was,
as I reminded her, “Before the French Revolution,
when the starving people came to the
queen’s palace clamouring for bread, the queen
innocently exclaimed, ‘Why don’t they eat
cake?’”</p>

<p>“How disagreeable you are! You think of
no one but yourself. I’ve come here for a little
change, to get away from my own troubles, and
here you come with your hatefulness.”</p>

<p>I hadn’t known the relief of laughter, but
now that I was started I couldn’t stop, no more
than I could stop staring at her. I tried to
associate this new being of silks and jewels with
her who had worked side by side with me in the
factory.</p>

<p>“How you act! I think you’re crazy,” she
admonished, and glanced at her wrist-watch.
“I’m late for my appointment with the manicurist.
I have to have my nails done after this
dusty railway trip.”</p>

<p>And I had been surprised at the insensate
settlement worker, at my uncomprehending
American friend who knew not the meaning of
want. Yet here was my own sister, my own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
flesh and blood, reared in the same ghetto,
nurtured in the same poverty, ground in the same
sweat-shop treadmill, and because she had a
few years of prosperity, because she ate well
and dressed well and was secure, she was deaf
to my cry.</p>

<p>Where I could hope for understanding, where
I could turn for shelter, where I was to lay my
head that very night, I knew not. But this much
suddenly came to me, I was due to report for
work that day. I was shut out on every side,
but there in my office at least awaited me the
warmth and sunshine of an assured welcome.
My employer would understand and let me take
off the remainder of the day to continue my
search.</p>

<p>I found him out, and instead awaiting me
was a pile of mail which he had left word I
should attend to. The next hour was torture.
My power of concentration had deserted me. I
tapped the keys of my typewriter with my fingers,
but my brain was torn with worry, my nerves
ready to snap. The day was nearly spent.
Night was coming on and I had no place to lay
my head.</p>

<p>I was finishing the last of the letters when he
came. After a friendly greeting he turned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
the letters. I dared not interrupt until the mail
was signed.</p>

<p>“Girl! What’s wrong? That’s not like
you!” He stared at me. “There are a dozen
mistakes in each letter.”</p>

<p>A blur. Everything seemed to twist and
turn around me. Red and black spots blinded
me. A clenched hand pounded his desk, and I
heard a voice that seemed to come from me—scream
like a lunatic. “I have no home—no
home—not even a bed for the night!”</p>

<p>Then all I remember is the man’s kindly
tone as he handed me a glass of water. “Are
you feeling better?” he asked.</p>

<p>“My landlady put me out,” I said between
laboured breaths. “Oh-h, I’m so lonely! Not
a place to lay my head!”</p>

<p>I saw him fumble for his pocket-book and
look at me strangely. His burning gaze seemed
to strip me naked—pierce me through and
through from head to foot. Something hurt so
deep I choked with shame. I seized my hat and
coat and ran out.</p>

<p>It was getting dark when I reached the
entrance of Central Park. Exhausted, I
dropped to the nearest bench. I didn’t even
know I was crying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>“Are you lonely, little one?” A hand
slipped around my waist and a dapper young
chap moved closer. “Are you lonely?” he
repeated.</p>

<p>I let him talk. I knew he had nothing real
to offer, but I was so tired, so ready to drop
the burden of my weary body that I had no
resistance in me. “There’s no place for me,”
I thought to myself. “Everyone shuts me out.
What difference what becomes of me? Who
cares?”</p>

<p>My head dropped to his shoulder. And the
cry broke from me, “I have no place to sleep
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Sleep?” I could feel him draw in his
breath and a blood-shot gleam leaped into his
eyes. “You should worry. I’ll take care of that.”</p>

<p>He flashed a roll of bills tauntingly. “How
about it, kiddo? Can you change me a twenty-dollar
bill?”</p>

<p>As his other hand reached for me, I wrenched
loose from him as from the cloying touch of
pitch. “I wish I were that kind! I wish I
were your kind! But I’m not!”</p>

<p>His hands dropped from the touch of me as
though his flesh was scorched, and I found I was
alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>I walked again. At the nearest public telephone
office I called up the women’s hotels.
None had a room left for less than two dollars.
My remaining cash was forty cents short. The
Better Housing Bureau had robbed me of my
last hope of shelter.</p>

<p>I passed Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue
mansions. Many were closed, standing empty.
I began counting the windows, the rooms.
Hundreds and hundreds of empty rooms,
hundreds and hundreds of luxuriously furnished
homes, and I homeless—shut out. I felt I was
abandoned by God and man and no one cared
if I perished or went mad. I had a fresh sense
why the spirit of revolution was abroad in the
land.</p>

<p>Blindly I retraced my steps to the park bench.
I saw and felt nothing but a devouring sense of
fear. It suddenly came over me that I was not
living in a world of human beings, but in a jungle
of savages who gorged themselves with food,
gorged themselves with rooms, while I implored
only a bed for the night. And I implored in
vain.</p>

<p>I felt the chaos and destruction of the good
and the beautiful within me and around me. The
sight of people who lived in homes and ate three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
meals a day filled me with the fury of hate. The
wrongs and injustices of the hungry and the
homeless of all past ages burst from my soul like
the smouldering lava of a blazing volcano. Earth-quakes
of rebellion raced through my body and
brain. I fell prone against the bench and wept,
not tears, but blood.</p>

<p>“Move along! No loitering here!” The
policeman’s club tapped me on the shoulder.
Then a woman stopped and bent over me.</p>

<p>I couldn’t move. I couldn’t lift my head.</p>

<p>“Tell your friend to cut out the sob-stuff,”
the officer continued, flourishing his club authoritatively.
“On your way, both of youse. Y’know
better than to loaf around here, Mag.”</p>

<p>The woman put her hand on mine in a
friendly little gesture of protection. “Leave her
alone! Can’t you see she’s all in? I’ll take care
of her.”</p>

<p>Her touch filled me with the warmth of
shelter. I didn’t know who or what she was, but
I trusted her.</p>

<p>“Poor kid! What ails her? It’s a rough
world all alone.”</p>

<p>There was no pity in her tone, but comprehension,
fellowship. From childhood I’d had
my friendships and many were dear to me. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
this woman, without a word, without a greeting,
had sounded the depths of understanding that I
never knew existed. Even as I looked up at her
she lifted me from the bench and almost carried
me through the arbour of trees to the park
entrance. My own mother couldn’t have been
more gentle. For a moment it seemed to me as
though the spirit of my dead mother had risen
from her grave in the guise of this unknown
friend.</p>

<p>Only once the silence between us was broken.
“Down in your luck, kid?” Her grip tightened
on my arm. “I’ve been there myself. I know
all about it.”</p>

<p>She knew so well, what need had she of
answer. The refrain came back to me: “Only
themselves understand themselves and the
likes of themselves, as souls only understand
souls.”</p>

<p>In a darkened side street we paused in front
of a brown stone house with shutters drawn.</p>

<p>“Here we are! Now for some grub! I’ll
bet a nickel you ain’t ate all day.” She vaulted
the rickety stairs two at a time and led the way
into her little room. With a gay assertiveness
she planted me into her one comfortable chair,
attempting no apology for her poverty—a poverty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
that winked from every corner and could not be
concealed. Flinging off her street clothes, she
donned a crimson kimono, and rummaged
through her soap-box in which her cooking
things were kept. She wrung her hands with
despair as though she suffered because she
couldn’t change herself into food.</p>

<p>Ah! the magic of love! It was only tea and
toast and an outer crust of cheese she offered—but
she offered it with the bounty of a princess.
Only the kind look in her face and the smell of
the steaming tray as she handed it to me—and I
was filled before I touched the food to my lips.
Somehow this woman who had so little had
fed me as people with stuffed larders never
could.</p>

<p>Under the spell of a hospitality so real that
it hurt like divine, beautiful things hurt, I felt
ashamed of my hysterical worries. I looked up
at her and marvelled. She was so full of God-like
grace—and so unconscious of it!</p>

<p>Not until she had tucked the covers warmly
around me did I realize that I was occupying the
only couch she had.</p>

<p>“But where will you sleep?” I questioned.</p>

<p>A funny little laugh broke from her. “I
should worry where I sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“It’s so snug and comfy,” I yawned, my eyes
heavy with fatigue. “It’s good to take from
you——”</p>

<p>“Take? Aw, dry up, kid! You ain’t taking
nothing,” she protested, embarrassed. “Tear off
some sleep and forget it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get close to the wall and make room for
you,” I murmured as I dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>When I woke up I found, to my surprise, the
woman was sleeping in a chair with a shawl
wrapped around her like a huge statue. The half
of the bed which she had left for me had
remained untouched.</p>

<p>“You were sleeping so sound I didn’t want
to wake you,” she said as she hurried to prepare
the breakfast.</p>

<p>I rose, refreshed, restored—sane. It was
more than gratitude that rushed out of my heart
to her. I felt I belonged to someone, I had found
home at last.</p>

<p>As I was ready to leave for work I turned to
her. “I am coming back to-night,” I said.</p>

<p>She fell back of a sudden as though I had
struck her. From the quick pain that shone in
her face I knew I had hurt something deep within
her. Her eyes met mine in a fixed gaze but she
did not see me, but stared through me into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
vacancy of space. She seemed to have forgotten
my presence, and when she spoke her voice was
like that of one in a trance. “You don’t know
what you’re asking. I—ain’t—no good.”</p>

<p>“You no good? God from the world!
Where would I have been without you? Even
my own sister shut me out. Of them all, you
alone opened the door and spread for me all you
had.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t so stuck on myself as the <i>good</i>
people, although I was as good as any of them
at the start. But the first time I got into trouble,
instead of helping me, they gave me the marble
stare and the frozen heart and drove me to the
bad.”</p>

<p>I looked closely at her, at the dyed hair, the
rouged lips, the defiant look of the woman driven
by the Pharisees from the steps of the temple.
Then I saw beneath. It was as though her body
dropped away from her and there stood revealed
her soul—the sorrows that gave her understanding—the
shame and the heartbreak that she
turned into love.</p>

<p>“What is good or bad?” I challenged. “All
I know is that I was hungry and you fed me.
Shelterless and you sheltered me. Broken in
spirit and you made me whole——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“That stuff’s all right, but you’re better off
out of here.”</p>

<p>I started towards her in mute protest.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch me,” she cried. “Can’t you
see—the smut all over me? Ain’t it in my
face?”</p>

<p>Her voice broke. And like one possessed of
sudden fury, she seized me by the shoulder and
shoved me out.</p>

<p>As the door slammed I heard sobbing—loosened
torrents of woe. I sank to my knees.
A light not of this earth poured through the door
that had shut on me. A holiness enveloped me.</p>

<p>This woman had changed the world for me.
I could love the people I had hated yesterday.
There was that something new in me, a light that
the dingiest rooming house could not dim nor
all the tyranny of the landlady shut out.</p>

<p>Vague, half remembered words flashed before
me in letters of fire. “Despised and rejected of
men: a woman of sorrows acquainted with grief.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DREAMS_AND_DOLLARS">DREAMS AND DOLLARS</h2>
</div>


<p>Spring was in the air. But such radiant,
joyous spring as one coming out of the dark
shadows of the ghetto never could dream. Earth
and sky seemed to sing with the joy of an unceasing
holiday. Rebecca Yudelson felt as
though she had suddenly stepped into fairyland,
where the shadow of sorrow or sickness, where
the black blight of poverty had never been.</p>

<p>An ecstasy of wonder and longing shone from
her hungry, young eyes as she gazed at the
luxurious dwellings. Such radiance of colour!
Fruits, flowers and real orange-trees! Beauty
and plenty! Each house outshone the other in
beauty and plenty.</p>

<p>Fresh from the East Side tenements, worn
from the nerve-racking grind of selling ribbons
at the Five and Ten Cent Store, the residential
section of Los Angeles was like a magic world
of romance too perfect to be real. She had often
seen the Fifth Avenue palaces of the New York
millionaires when she had treated herself to a
bus ride on a holiday. But nothing she had ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
seen before compared with this glowing
splendour.</p>

<p>“And in one of these mansions of sunshine
and roses my own sister lives!” she breathed.
“How could Minnie get used to so much free
space and sunshine for every day?”</p>

<p>Ten years since Minnie had left Delancey
Street. Ten years’ freedom from the black worry
for bread. There must have come a new sureness
in her step, a new joy of life in her every movement.
And to think that Abe Shmukler from
cloaks and suits had bought her and brought her
to this new world!</p>

<p>Rebecca wondered if her sister ever thought
back to Felix Weinberg, the poet who had loved
her and whom she had given up to marry this
bank account man.</p>

<p>With the passionate ardour of adolescence
Rebecca had woven an idyll for herself out of her
sister’s love affair. Felix Weinberg had become
for her the symbol of beauty and romance. His
voice, his face, the lines he had written to Minnie,
coloured Rebecca’s longings and dreams. With
the love cadence of the poet’s voice still stirring
in her heart, she put her finger on the door bell.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a trim maid in black,
whose superior scrutiny left Rebecca speechless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>Her own sister Minnie with a stiff lady for a
servant!</p>

<p>“My sister, is she in? I just came from New
York.”</p>

<p>“Rebecca!” cried a familiar voice, as she
was smothered in hungry arms. “<i>Oi weh!</i> How
many years! You were yet so little then. Now
you’re a grown-up person.” And overcome by
the memories of their ghetto days together, they
sobbed in one another’s arms.</p>

<p>Rebecca had been prepared for a change in
Minnie. Ten years of plenty. But to think that
Abe Shmukler with his cloaks and suits could
have blotted out the fine sensitiveness of the
sister she had loved and left in its place his own
gross imprint! Minnie’s thin long fingers were
now heavy and weighted with diamonds. The
slender lines of her figure had grown bulky with
fat.</p>

<p>“And to think that you who used to shine up
the street like a princess in your home-mades are
such a fashion-plate now?” Rebecca laughed
reproachfully.</p>

<p>They drew apart and gazed achingly at one
another. Rebecca’s soul grew faint within her
as though her own flesh and blood had grown
alien to her. Why couldn’t Minnie have lifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
Abe to her high thoughts? Why did she let him
drag her down to his cloaks and suits—make her
a thing of store-bought style?</p>

<p>“Minnie—Minnie!” the younger sister wept,
bewildered. “Where have you gone? What
have you done with yourself?”</p>

<p>Minnie brushed away her tears and laughed
away her sister’s reproach. “Did you want me
to remain always an East Side <i>venteh</i>?”</p>

<p>Then she hugged the young sister with a fresh
burst of affection. “Rebecca, you little witch!
All you need is a little style. I’ll take you to
the best stores, and when I get through with you
no one will guess that you came from Delancey
Street.”</p>

<p>“You have the same old heart, Minnie,
although you shine like a born Mrs. Vanderbilt.”</p>

<p>“No wonder you have no luck for a man with
these clothes,” Minnie harped back to the thing
uppermost in her mind.</p>

<p>“But you weren’t fixed up in style when Felix
Weinberg was so crazy about you.”</p>

<p>“Do you ever see him?” came eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I meet him every once in a while, but
his thoughts are far away when he talks to me.”
She paused, overcome by a rush of feeling.
“Sometimes, in my dreams, I feel myself crying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
out to him, ‘Look at me! Can’t you see I’m
here?’”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a little fool and let yourself fall
in love with a poet. He’s all right for poetry,
but to get married you need a man who can make
a living. I sent for you not only because I was
lonesome and wanted you near, but because I
have a man who’ll be a great catch for you. He’s
full of money and crazy to marry himself.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t there plenty of girls in California for
him?”</p>

<p>“But he’s like Abe. He wants the plain,
settled down kind.”</p>

<p>“Am I the plain, settled-down kind like my
sister?” thought Rebecca.</p>

<p>And so the whole afternoon sped by in
reminiscence of the past and golden plans for the
future. Minnie told with pride that her children
were sent to a swell camp, where they rubbed
sleeves with the millionaires’ children of California.
Abe had sold out the greater share of
his cloaks and suits business to Moe Mirsky—this
very man whom Minnie had picked out for
Rebecca.</p>

<p>“And if we have the luck to land him, I’ll
charge you nothing for the matchmaking. My
commission will be to have you live near me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>Before Rebecca could answer there was a
footstep in the outer hall and a hearty voice
called: “So your sister has come! No wonder
you’re not standing by the door waiting to kiss
your husband.”</p>

<p>Abe Shmukler, fatter and more prosperous
than ten years ago, filled the doorway with his
bulk. “Now there’ll be peace in the house,” he
exploded genially. “I’ve had nothing from my
wife but cryings from lonesomeness since I
brought her here. You’ll have to keep my wife
company till we get you a man.”</p>

<p>Instinctively Rebecca responded to the fulsomeness
of Abe’s greeting. His sincerity, his
simple joy in welcoming her, touched her. She
wondered if her sister had been quite fair to this
big, happy-hearted man.</p>

<p>And even as she wondered the vision of Felix
Weinberg stood before her. This man of fire
and romance and dreams, against Abe Shmukler,
was like sunrise and moonrise and song against
cloaks and suits. How could any woman who
had known the fiery wonder of the poet be content
with this tame, ox-like husband?</p>

<p>“I’ve already picked out a man for you, so
you can settle near us for good,” said Abe, giving
Rebecca another affectionate hug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>Again her heart warmed to him. He was so
well intentioned, so lovable. The world needed
these plain, bread-and-butter men. Their
affection-craving natures, their generous instincts,
kept the home fires burning.</p>

<p>Abe fulfilled the great essentials of life. He
was a good provider, a good husband, a good
father and a genial host. But though he could
feed her sister with the fat of the land, what
nourishment could this stolid bread-giver provide
for the heart, the soul, the mind?</p>

<p>Rebecca’s reverie was interrupted by the
jangle of the telephone.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it’s already that man asking if you
arrived.” Abe winked at his wife and twitted
his sister-in-law under the chin as he picked up
the receiver.</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s here,” Rebecca heard Abe say.
And turning to his wife: “Minnie, our friend
Moe is coming for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Coming right for dinner,” cried Minnie.
“Quickly we must fix you up. I can’t have that
man see you looking like a greenhorn just off the
ship.”</p>

<p>Rebecca surveyed herself critically in the gilt
mirror. The excitement of the arrival had
brought a faint flush to her cheeks. Her hair had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
become softer, wavier in the moist California
air.</p>

<p>“Why can’t I see your Rockefeller prince as
I am?” Rebecca was not aware that her charm
was enhanced by the very simplicity of her attire.
“Is he so high tone that plain me is not good
enough for him?”</p>

<p>Her sister cut short her objections and
hurried her upstairs, where she tried on one
gown after another. But they were all too
big.</p>

<p>Then on a sudden thought she snatched a
long, fillet scarf, which she draped loosely around
Rebecca’s neck.</p>

<p>“Why, you look like a picture for a painter.”
Even Minnie, accustomed now to the last word
in style, recognized that the little sister had a
charm of personality that needed no store-bought
clothes to set it off.</p>

<p>Awaiting them at the foot of the stairs was
the smiling Abe. Behind him with one hand
grasping the banisters stood a short stocky young
man. Under his arm he held tightly to his side
a heart-shaped box of candy tied with a flowing
red ribbon.</p>

<p>“My, look him over, kid! Ain’t he the
swellest feller you ever set your eyes on? Ain’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
you glad you left your ribbon counter for your
California prince?”</p>

<p>Moe’s colour outshone the red ribbon which
tied his box of candy. With a clumsy flourish,
he bowed and offered it to the girl. In a panic
of confusion, Rebecca let the box slip from her
nervous fingers. And Moe stooped jerkily to
recover it.</p>

<p>And Abe burst into loud laughter.</p>

<p>“On! Solemiel!” Minnie cried, shaking
him by the arm. “You’re a grand brother-in-law.”
And led the way to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Never had Rebecca seen such a rich spread
of luxuries. Roast squabs, a silver platter of
<i>gerfulta</i> fish, shimmering cut glass containing
chopped chicken livers and spiced jellies. The
under-nourished girl saw for the first time a feast
of plenty fit for millionaires.</p>

<p>“What’s this—a holiday?” she asked,
recovering her voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t think you’re yet in Delancey Street,”
admonished the host. “In California the fat of
the land is for every day.”</p>

<p>As they fell to the food Rebecca understood
the over-fed look of those about her. She wondered
if she would have sufficient self-control not
to make a pig of herself with such delicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
plenty, making the eyes glisten, the mouth water,
and the heart glad as with song.</p>

<p>Rebecca, watching Moe as he smacked his
lips in enjoyment of every mouthful, understood
why he wanted the plain, settled-down kind of
girl. A home, a wife, and fat dimpling babies
belonged to him as flowers and all green-growing
things belong to the earth.</p>

<p>“Nu, could you tell on my sister-in-law that
she never had meat except on a holiday the way
she eats like a bird?” Abe began anew his
raillery. And it was not until after dinner, when
Minnie dragged her Abe away to a neighbour,
that Moe and Rebecca had a chance to talk
together.</p>

<p>“I got something grand to show you,” Moe
burst out once the road was clear. Why waste
time and words in the slow love-making of cheap
skates who haven’t the shekels to show? His
money could talk. And he led her out proudly
to see his red-lacquered limousine. “Swellest
car in the market, and I got it the minute your
sister said you were coming.”</p>

<p>Rebecca was thrilled with this obvious
flattery. It was the first time she had had a man
so on his knees to her.</p>

<p>“To-morrow I take you for a ride,” he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
with the sure tone that came into his voice when
he concluded a good sale of cloaks and suits.</p>

<p>She nodded happily as they walked back to
the parlour. Moe continued his eager questions.
Was she crazy for the movies? Did they have
good vaudeville out there on the East Side?
Why did she not come sooner to California?
His eyes travelled over the girl with thick satisfaction.
“How becoming it would be to your
diamonds on your neck!” And he rubbed his
palms ecstatically.</p>

<p>It was good to be made love to even though
the man was not a poet.</p>

<p>Till now she had only eaten out her heart for
a look, a word, from Felix Weinberg. What a
fool she was not to have come to California a
year ago as Minnie had begged her.</p>

<p>“I was so scared I’d be lonesome here, so far
away from what I’m used to,” she said, with a
look that told him that a woman’s home is where
love is. “Now I wonder how I’ll ever be able
to go back,” she finished softly.</p>

<p>“Go back! You got to stay!” he commanded
masterfully. “And I’ll see that you
shouldn’t be so skinny. You got to eat more.”
And suiting his action to his word, he forced
more candy upon the already over-filled girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>Then he offered to teach her how to play
cards. “Minnie and Abe are such grand poker
players,” he explained.</p>

<p>“My sister Minnie playing cards?”</p>

<p>“Shah! Little queen, you’ll have to learn
cards, too. There ain’t no other pleasure for
women here, except cards or the movies or
vaudeville, and the bills don’t change more than
once a week.” And he told her that it was the
custom in their group to play every night in a
different house.</p>

<p>A sudden pity gripped him. He longed to
brighten the lonely look of this little greenhorn,
put roses into her pale thin cheeks.</p>

<p>“Tell me what is your best pleasure,” he
asked with the sweeping manner of a Rothschild.</p>

<p>“Ach! How I love music!” The glow of
an inner sun lit up her face. “I can’t afford a
seat in the opera, but even if I have to stand all
evening and save the pennies from my mouth,
music I’ve got to have.”</p>

<p>“Hah—ha!” He laughed in advance of his
own humour. “My sweetest music is the click
of the cash register. The ring of the dollars I
make is grander to me than the best songs on the
phonograph.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>His face became suddenly alive. For the
first time she saw Moe galvanized into a man of
action, a man of power. The light that burned
throughout the ages in the eyes of poets and
prophets burned also in the eyes of the traders of
her race.</p>

<p>“When I was a little hungry boy in the
gutters of the ghetto, the only songs I heard were
the bargaining cries over pennies. Even when
I worked myself up to a clothing store in Division
Street they were still tearing my flesh in pieces,
squeezing out cheaper, another dime, another
nickel from a suit.” But the eloquent story of
his rise in the world till now—here he was king
of clothing—fell upon deaf ears. Rebecca had
ceased to listen.</p>

<p>She saw again their kitchen on Sunday night.
Felix Weinberg’s pale face under the sputtering
gas jet, her sister leaning eagerly forward, her
hand instinctively reaching towards him across
the table, her face alight with the inner radiance
that glowed from him like a burning sun. She,
Rebecca, close to him, at his feet, all a-tremble
with the nearness of him. The children on his
knees, clutching at his neck, peering from behind
his shoulder. The eternal cadences of Keats and
Shelley, the surging rhythm of their song playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
upon their hearts, holding them enthralled with
a music that they felt all the more deeply because
they did not understand.</p>

<p>Even mother, clattering busily with the pots
at the stove, would pause in her work, drawn by
the magic of the enraptured group.</p>

<p>“<i>Nu</i>, with a clean apron I’m also a person to
listen,” she said as she tore from her the soiled
rag which she wore around the stove and reached
for a clean blue-checked apron that she wore only
for holidays.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>Mammeniu</i>!” Felix would respond.
“In honour of this shining beautifulness, I’ll
read something special for you,” and he would,
opening his Browning. At the words Rabbi Ben
Ezra, <i>Mammeniu’s</i> sigh was the joy of a child in
fairyland.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Grow old along with me. The best is yet to be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The last of life for which the first was made.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then like a child repeating its well-loved
lesson for the hundredth time, “<i>Nu</i>, I didn’t yet
live out my years,” she would breathe happily.
“It will only begin my real life when my children
work themselves up in America.”</p>

<p>What matter if they had only potato-soup for
supper—only the flavour of fried onions in a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
suet to take the place of meat? What matter
if the only two chairs were patched with boards
and the rickety table had for its support a potato
barrel? Wonder and beauty filled the room.
Voices of poets and prophets of all time were
singing in their hearts.</p>

<p>And all that Minnie had given up. For what?
For silver platters with <i>gefulta</i> fish. For roast
squabs. For spiced jellies. And the dollar music
from cash registers.</p>

<p>Yes, Minnie, like this blustering Moe, had
worked herself up in America. She had a rich
house, a Rolls-Royce car, a lady servant to wait
on her body. But what had happened to her
spirit, her soul—the soul that had once been
watered and flowered with the love songs of a
poet?</p>

<p>“You see, in California nobody worries for
bread,” broke in the heavy guttural voice of Moe
Mirsky. “People’s only trouble is how to enjoy
themselves.”</p>

<p>Excited, high-pitched voices from the hallway,
and Minnie and Abe entered. “So much
your sister is crazy for you that she tore herself
away from the cards to be with you the first
night,” said Abe with an inquisitive, quizzical
look at the young couple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“And I was winning at the first shot, too,”
Minnie added.</p>

<p>“My wife is the best poker player in the
bunch,” Abe asserted. “Wait, you’ll see Friday
night when they come around.” And turning
back to Moe: “You’ve got to teach her quick
the cards so she can join the company.”</p>

<p>“Cards don’t go in her head at all.” Moe
looked with unconcealed proprietorship at his
future wife. “I guess she ain’t yet used to a
little pleasure. Let’s only introduce her to our
society, and she’ll soon learn what it is in good
time.”</p>

<p>The next few days were spent in a wild orgy
of shopping. Not only was Rebecca to be made
presentable to the higher society in which
generous Abe was anxious she should shine, but
Minnie was also preparing herself for a month’s
vacation in Cataline Islands with some of Abe’s
new real estate friends. As Abe’s wife it was a
matter of business that she should be more richly
dressed than the wives of his prosperous competitors.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life Rebecca saw
things bought, not because they were needed, but
because they appealed to her sister’s insatiable
eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“When will you ever have enough things?”
Rebecca remonstrated. “Why are we going from
store to store like a couple of drunkards from
bar to bar? The more you buy, the more drunk
you get to buy more.”</p>

<p>“Just only this one dress. That’s the newest
thing in style and so becoming.”</p>

<p>“But you have so much already. Your closet
is so stacked full.”</p>

<p>“I saw Mrs. Rosenbaum wear something like
it. And Abe wouldn’t want she should come
dressed better than I.”</p>

<p>At last Rebecca was to meet her sister’s
society friends. Although Minnie and Abe
despaired of making little Rebecca stylish, they
were satisfied by Friday night that at least she
could be introduced without her Delancey Street
background too evident.</p>

<p>The dining-room table covered with green
baize was piled high with pyramids of poker
chips. Packs of cards were on the table. A
mahogany cellarette laden with Scotch, cognac,
bottles of White Rock and high-ball glasses stood
near by.</p>

<p>Minnie was radiant in a black-and-gold
spangled dress. The shine of Abe’s cheeks outshone
the diamond that glistened from his shirt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
front. Moe, who had arrived before the rest of
the guests, had brought Rebecca another heart-shaped
gift, containing “the most smelly perfume
in the whole drug store.”</p>

<p>Before the guests arrived Moe devoted himself
to showing Rebecca the sequence of the
cards, but try as she would she could make no
sense out of it.</p>

<p>“It’s such a waste of time. It’s so foolish,
so brainless....”</p>

<p>“Is it foolish, brainless, to win five hundred,
a thousand, in one little night?” cried Moe, the
ring of the cash register in his voice.</p>

<p>“It’s not only to win money,” broke in
Minnie. “Cards are life to me. When I play
I get so excited I forget about everything.
There’s no past, no future—only the now, the life
of the game.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” put in Abe doggedly.
“When you win you’re crazy to grab in more,
and when you lose you’re crazy to stake it all to
win again.”</p>

<p>Dimly Rebecca began to see the lure of
gambling. It was as contagious as small-pox.
Minnie had caught the poison from Abe and his
friends. In a world where there was no music,
no books, no spiritual stimulus, where people had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
nothing but money, what else was there to fill the
eternal emptiness but excitement?</p>

<p>The guests arrived. Mrs. Rosenbaum and
her husband, the biggest department store owner
of Los Angeles. Mr. and Mrs. Soikolsky, real
estate owners of half of Hollywood. Mr.
Einstein, the Tecla of California, whose wife and
children had just sailed for the Orient.</p>

<p>As Rebecca was introduced to one solid
citizen after another, she was unable to distinguish
between them. The repellently prosperous
look of the “all-rightnik” stamped them all.
The vulgar boastfulness of the man who had
forced his way up in the world only to look down
with smug superiority upon his own people.</p>

<p>“Always with your thoughts in the air,”
chuckled Moe, a stubby hand tenderly reaching
towards her.</p>

<p>The sad eyes of the little greenhorn stirred
vague memories in his heart. Warming things
welled up in him to say to her. But Abe interrupted
by calling the guests to their places.</p>

<p>A wave of expectancy swept over the gathering
as they elbowed themselves about the table.
Eyes sharp. Measuring glances shot from one
to the other. A business-like air settled upon
the group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>Abe poured a generous drink of whisky for
each. “<i>Nu</i>, my friends, only get yourself drunk
enough so I can have a chance to win once from
you.”</p>

<p>A fresh pack of cards was opened. The deal
fell to the tight-laced, high-bosomed Mrs.
Rosenbaum, whose fat fingers flashed with
diamonds as she dealt.</p>

<p>“You got to sit here, by me, all evening to
bring me luck,” Moe whispered in Rebecca’s ear,
and drew a chair for her alongside of him.</p>

<p>An audible silence pervaded the room. The
serious business of the game began.</p>

<p>Unconsciously Rebecca was caught by the
contagion of their excitement. She even began
to hope that Minnie would win, that she would
bring luck to the well-meaning Moe.</p>

<p>“Usual limit five dollars,” Abe declared.</p>

<p>Moe explained that the white chips represented
one dollar, the blue two, the red five, and
the yellow ten.</p>

<p>Slowly the air became filled with smoke and
the smell of alcohol. The betting rose higher
and higher. Rebecca could stand it no longer
and rushed from the room to the parlour. She
looked with sharp distaste at the gaudy furnishings.
Till now she had been taken in by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
glamour of her sister’s wealth. But now the
crowded riches of the place choked her. Who
had chosen all this? Her sister or her sister’s
husband? Here and there was a beautiful pillow
or finely woven rug, but its beauty was killed by
the loud clash of colour, the harsh glare of cheap
gilt. Cheapness and showiness stuck like varnish
over the costly fabrics of the room. It was a sort
of furniture display Rebecca had often seen in
department stores. It smelled cloaks and
suits.</p>

<p>The vivid pale face of the poet, with eyes that
burned with the fire of beauty, gazed accusingly
at the rich velvet hangings and overstuffed
furniture that had won Minnie away from him.</p>

<p>How different Minnie’s home would have
been if she had married the poet! A small
room in a tenement. A bare floor. A bare
table. A room that lacked beautiful things but
was filled with beautiful thoughts. Felix Weinberg’s
flaming presence, the books he read, the
dreams he dreamed, the high thoughts that lit
up his face would have filled the poorest room
with sunshine.</p>

<p>The shrill voices of the dining-room startled
her.</p>

<p>“Ach! What’s the matter?” Rebecca<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
gasped in a panic. “Are they killing themselves?”
and hurried in.</p>

<p>She could hardly distinguish the faces, so
thick was the air with smoke and whisky fumes.
The look of wild animals distorted their features.
Mrs. Rosenbaum’s hair had slipped from its net.
Her own sister was flushed, dishevelled. Moe’s
face was set in sullen, bitter lines as he called
for more money. A scoffing devil of greed
seemed to possess them all. It was Bedlam let
loose.</p>

<p>“No use showing that you come from Division
Street, even if you did lose a couple of
hundred,” Minnie shrilled savagely at Moe.</p>

<p>“You’re worse than that push-cart, Kike,”
leered the half-drunken Abe. “What a wife!
What a wife! She’d steal the whites out from
my eyes. She’d grab the gold out of my teeth.”</p>

<p>There followed an avalanche of abuse between
her sister, her husband and the sodden Moe.
Rebecca had never heard such language used.</p>

<p>“They’re only drunk. They don’t know what
they’re saying,” she apologized for them herself.</p>

<p>Thank God, her mother, her father couldn’t
see what cloaks and suits had made of Minnie.
Her own sister a common card-player! Where
was that gentle bud of a girl that Felix had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
loved? How was that fine spirit of hers lost in
this wild lust for excitement? And these people
whom she called friends, this very Moe whom
she had picked out for her to marry—what were
they? All-rightniks—the curse of their people,
the shame of their race, Jews dehumanized, destroyed
by their riches. Glutted stomachs—starved
souls, escaped from the prison of poverty
to smother themselves in the fleshpots of plenty.</p>

<p>It was towards noon the next day that Minnie
with dull, puffy eyes and aching head stumbled
into Rebecca’s room. The half-filled valise was
on the bed, clothes were piled on chairs, and the
trunk open as though ready for packing.</p>

<p>“What’s this? Are you eloping with Moe?”
Minnie was too spent from the night of excitement
to be surprised at anything, but a closer
look at Rebecca’s tear-stained face aroused her
from her apathy. “<i>Yok!</i> Can’t you speak?”
she demanded irritably.</p>

<p>“My God! How can you stand it here—this
life of the flesh? What have you here, in
this land of plenty, but overeating, oversleeping——”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I over-eat?” Minnie hurled
back. “I was starved enough all my youth.
Never knew the taste of meat or milk till I came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
here. I slaved long enough in the sweat-shop.
The world owes me a little rest.” Her face
grew hard with bitter memories. “I don’t know
how I stood it there, in the dirt of Delancey
Street, ten people in three rooms, like herrings in
a barrel, without a bath-tub, without——”</p>

<p>“Marble bath-tubs—bathing yourself morning
and night don’t yet keep your soul alive.
How could you have sunk yourself into such
drunken card-playing?”</p>

<p>“If not for cards I’d be dead from loneliness.
Are there any people to talk to here?”
She threw out bediamonded hands in a gesture
of helplessness. “I hate Abe like poison when
he’s home so much of the time. Cards and
clothes help me run away from myself—help me
forget my terrible emptiness.” Minnie reached
out imploringly to her sister. “Here you see
how I’m dying before your eyes, and yet you
want to leave me.”</p>

<p>Rebecca felt herself growing hard and inhuman.
Didn’t she love her sister enough to
respond to her cry of loneliness? But the next
moment she knew that though it tore the heart
out of her body she could never stand this bloated
ease of the flesh into which Minnie was trying to
beguile her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“Would you want me to marry Moe and bury
myself alive in cloaks and suits like you? I’d
rather starve on dry crusts where life is real,
where there’s still hope for higher things. It
would kill me to stay here another day. Your
fine food, your fresh air, your velvet limousine
smothers me.... It’s all a desert of emptiness
painted over with money. Nothing is real. The
sky is too blue. The grass is too green. This
beauty is all false paint, hiding dry rot. There’s
only one hope for you. Leave your killing
comforts and come with me.”</p>

<p>“And what about the children?” Minnie
leaped to her feet in quick defence. “I want
them to have a chance in life. I couldn’t bear
to have them go through the misery and dirt that
nearly killed me. You’re not a mother. You
don’t know a mother’s heart.”</p>

<p>“Your mother’s heart—it’s only selfishness!
You’re only trying to save yourself the pain of
seeing your children go through the struggle that
made you what you are. No,” she corrected,
“that made you what you once were.”</p>

<p>Rebecca towered over her sister like the living
spirit of struggle revolting against the deadening
inertia of ease.</p>

<p>“What is this chance that you are giving your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
children? To rub sleeves with millionaire children?
Will that feed their hungry young hearts?
Fire their spirits for higher things? Children’s
hands reach out for struggle. Their youth is
hungry for hardships, for danger, for the rough
fight with life even more than their bodies are
hungry for bread.”</p>

<p>Minnie looked at her little sister. From
where came that fire, that passion? She saw
again Felix Weinberg’s flaming eyes. She heard
again his biting truths, the very cadence of his
voice.</p>

<p>Minnie buried her throbbing head in the
pillows. As surely as Rebecca sold ribbons over
the counter at ten cents a yard, so surely Minnie
knew that she had sold her own soul for the
luxuries which Abe’s money had bought. And
now it was out of her power to call this real part
of her back. The virus of luxury had eaten into
her body and soul till she could no longer exist
without it.</p>

<p>“If I could only go back with you,” she
sobbed impotently, “if I could only go back.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Love and hate tore at Rebecca’s heart—love
of Minnie and hatred of the fleshpots that were
destroying her sister. The days and nights of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
journey home were spent in tortured groping for
the light. Ach—sisters! Flesh of one flesh,
blood of one blood, aching to help one another
in the loneliness of life, yet doomed like strangers
to meet only to part again.</p>

<p>If she could only talk out her confusion to
someone. Felix Weinberg! How he could
make her clear! And suddenly she knew—knew
with burning certainty that after ten years of
worshipping him at a distance she must come to
him face to face. Truth itself was driving her
to him.</p>

<p>As she got off the train, her feet instinctively
led her to the cellar café on East Broadway,
where far into the morning hours Felix Weinberg
and his high-thinking friends were to be found.</p>

<p>Even before she caught sight of him at a
corner table surrounded by his followers, she
felt a vast release. She looked in through the
grated window. How different these—her own
people—from the dollar-chasers she had just left!
The dirt, the very squalor of the place was life
to her, as the arrogant cleanliness, the strutting
shirt-fronts of cloaks and suits had deadened
her. Here rags talked high thoughts and world
philosophies, like princes at a royal court. Here
only what was in your heart and head counted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
not your bank account or the shine of your
diamonds.</p>

<p>Even the torn wall-plaster in this palace of
dreams had a magic all its own. The pictures,
the poems, the fragmentary bits of self-expression
that were scribbled everywhere were marks
of the vivid life that surged about—clamouring
to be heard.</p>

<p>She never knew how she got inside, but as in
a dream she heard herself talking to <i>him</i>—looking
straight into Felix’s eyes in a miraculously
natural way as though her whole life was but a
leading up to this grand moment.</p>

<p>The youth who used to light up their little
kitchen with his flaming presence was gone. In
his place had come a man grown strong with
suffering. Fine as silk and strong as steel shone
every feature. He was scarred with all the hurts
of the world—hurts that lay like whip lashes on
the furrows of his face. She felt nothing would
be too small or too big for him to understand.</p>

<p>“Years ago when I was only that big at your
feet,” Rebecca measured the table height with
her hand, “your words were life to me. Now
I come three thousand miles to talk my heart out
with you.” And she told him everything, her
doubt of herself, her hard intolerance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
plain bread-and-butter people, her revolt against
her own flesh and blood.</p>

<p>His face lit with quick comprehension. He
stopped sipping his glass of tea and leaned
towards her across the table. With every word,
with every gesture she revealed herself as one of
his own kind! This girl of whose existence he
had scarcely been aware all these years seemed
suddenly to have grown up under his very eyes,
and he had not seen her till now.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see, little heart,” he responded
warmly, “the dollars are their dreams. They
eat the fleshpots with the same passionate intensity
that they once fasted in faith on the Day of
Atonement. They’ve been hungry for so many
centuries. Let them eat! Give them only a
chance for a few generations. They’ll find their
souls again. The deeper down under the surface
you get, the more you see that the dollar-chasers
are also pursuing a dream, but their dream is
different from ours, that is all.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get to feel and know so
much?” she breathed adoringly.</p>

<p>He did not answer. But his eyes dwelt on
her in ardent reverie, marvelling at the gift of
the gods that she was. Through unceasing
frustration of the things for which he had striven,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
he had come to a point of understanding the
materialists no less than the dreamers. He had
learned to forgive even Minnie who had turned
from his love for the security of wealth. But
here was the glowing innocence of a girl with
the heart and brain of a woman—a woman in
his own poet’s world, one who had rejected the
fleshpots of her own free will. It was as though
after years of parching thirst life had suddenly
brought him a draught of wine, a heady vintage
of youth, of living poetry, of love perhaps.
Straining closer to her, he abandoned himself to
the exaltation that swept him and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>“No—no! It was Minnie you always
loved,” Rebecca gasped, frightened at his
ardour.</p>

<p>“Minnie I loved as a dreaming youth, a half-fledged
poet,” he flashed back at her. “But you—you——”</p>

<p>She knew now why she had come back home
again—back to the naked struggle for bread—back
to the crooked, narrow streets filled with
shouting children, the haggling push-carts and
bargaining housewives—back to the relentless,
penny-pinched poverty—but a poverty rich in
romance, in dreams—rich in its very hunger of
unuttered, unsung beauty.</p>

<p><i>The Story of Beret Pinsky, Poet of the People,
who Sold his Soul for Wealth</i></p>


<h3>§ 1</h3>

<p>“Where went your week’s wages?” demanded
Hanneh Breineh, her bony back
humping like an angry cat’s as she bent over the
washtub.</p>

<p>Terrified, Moisheh gazed wildly at the ceiling,
then dropped his eyes to the floor.</p>

<p>“Your whole week’s wages—where went it?”
insisted Hanneh.</p>

<p>She turned from the tub and brandished her
hands in his face.</p>

<p>“The shoes—Berel’s shoes,” Moisheh stumblingly
explained. “I—I had to buy him shoes
for his feet—not new shoes—only second-hand.”</p>

<p>“Shoes yet for such a loafer? I’d drive him
out naked—barefoot. Let him get the chills—the
fever—only to get rid from him quick!”</p>

<p>None of the roomers of Hanneh Breineh’s
lodging-house could escape her tyrannous inquisition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
Had she not been a second mother
to Moisheh, the pants presser, and to Berel, his
younger brother? Did she not cook their supper
for them every night, without any extra charge?
In return for this motherly service she demanded
a precise account of their expenditures of money
or time, and of every little personal detail of
their lives.</p>

<p>Red glints shot from Hanneh Breineh’s
sunken eyes.</p>

<p>“And for what more did you waste out my
rent money?”</p>

<p>“Books—he got to have ’em—more’n eating—more’n
life!”</p>

<p>“Got to have books?” she shrieked.
“Beggars—<i>schnorrers</i>—their rent not paid—their
clothes falling from them in rags—and yet
they buy themselves books!” Viciously slapping
the board with the shirt she had been rubbing,
she straightened and faced Moisheh menacingly.
“I been too good to you. I cooked and
washed for you, and killed myself away to help
you for nothing. So that’s my thanks!”</p>

<p>The door opened. A lean youth with shining
eyes and a dishevelled mass of black hair
rushed in.</p>

<p>“<i>Ach</i>, Moisheh! Already back from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
shop? My good luck—I’m choking to tell
you!”</p>

<p>The two drab figures huddled in the dim
kitchen between the washtub and the stove gazed
speechless at the boy. Even Hanneh Breineh
was galvanized for the moment by the ecstatic,
guileless face, the erect, live figure poised bird-like
with desire.</p>

<p>“<i>Oi</i>, golden heart!” The boy grasped
Moisheh’s arm impetuously. “A typewriter!
It’s worth fifty dollars—maybe more yet—and I
can get it for ten, if I grab it quick for cash!”</p>

<p>Moisheh glanced from the glowering landlady
to his ardent brother. His gentle heart
sank as he looked into Berel’s face, with its
undoubting confidence that so reasonable a want
would not be denied him.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think—maybe—ain’t there something
you could do to earn the money?”</p>

<p>“What more can I do than I’m already
doing? You think only pressing pants is
work?”</p>

<p>“Berel,” said Moisheh, with frank downrightness,
“you got your education. Why don’t you
take up a night school? They’re looking for
teachers.”</p>

<p>“Me a teacher? Me in that treadmill of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
deadness? Why, the dullest hand in a shop
got more chance to use his brains than a teacher
in their schools!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, go to work in a shop—only half-days—the
rest of the time give yourself over to
your dreams in the air.”</p>

<p>“Brother, are you gone crazy?” Berel
gesticulated wildly. “I should go into that
terrible sweat and grind of the machines? All
the fire that creates in me would die in a day!”</p>

<p>The poet looked at the toil-scarred face of
his peasant brother. For all his crude attempts
at sympathy, how could he, with the stink of
steam soaked into his clothes, with his poverty-crushed,
sweatshop mind—how could he understand
the anguish of thwarted creation, of high-hearted
hopes that died unvoiced?</p>

<p>“But everybody got to work,” Moisheh went
on. “All your poetry is grand, but it don’t pay
nothing.”</p>

<p>“Is my heart cry nothing, then? Nothing
to struggle by day and by night for the right
word in this strange English, till I bleed away
from the torture of thoughts that can’t come
out?”</p>

<p>Berel stopped, and his eyes seemed transfigured
with an inner light. His voice grew low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
and tense. Each word came deliberately, with
the precision he used when swayed by poetic
feeling.</p>

<p>“<i>Ach</i>, if I could only tell you of the visions
that come to me! They flash like burning
rockets over the city by night. Lips, eyes, a
smile—they whisper to me a thousand secrets.
The feelings that leap in my heart are like
rainbow-coloured playthings. I toss them and
wrestle with them; and yet I must harness them.
Only then can they utter the truth, when they
are clear and simple so that a young child could
understand.”</p>

<p>Turning swiftly, the words hissed from the
poet’s lips.</p>

<p>“Why do I have to bite the dirt for every
little crumb you give me? I, who give my life,
the beat of my heart, the blood of my veins, to
bring beauty into the world—why do I have to
beg—beg!”</p>

<p>He buried his face in his hands, utterly
overcome.</p>

<p>Moisheh, with an accusing glance at Hanneh
Breineh, as if she was in some measure to blame
for this painful outburst, soothed the trembling
Berel as one would a child.</p>

<p>“<i>Shah!</i>” He took from his pocket all his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
money. “Two dollars is all I yet got left, and
on this I must stick out till my wages next
Monday. But here, Berel, take half.”</p>

<p>Shamed by Moisheh’s generosity, and embittered
by the inadequacy of the sum, Berel’s
mood of passionate pleading gave way to sullenness.</p>

<p>“Keep it!” he flung over his shoulder, and
left the room.</p>


<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p>Berel’s thoughts surged wildly as he raced
through the streets.</p>

<p>“Why am I damned and despised by them
all? What is my crime? That I can’t compromise?
That I fight with the last breath to
do my work—the work for which I was born?”</p>

<p>Instinctively his feet led him to the public
library, his one sanctuary of escape from the
sordidness of the world. But now there seemed
no peace for him even here.</p>

<p>“Money—money!” kept pounding and
hammering in his ears. “Get money or be
blotted out!”</p>

<p>A tap on his shoulder. Berel turned and
looked into a genial face, sleeked and barbered
into the latest mould of fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“Jake Shapiro!” cried the poet.</p>

<p>Five years ago these two had met on the
ship bound for America. What dreams they
had dreamed together on that voyage—Berel
Pinsky, the poet, and Shapiro, the musician!</p>

<p>“What are you doing for a living? Still
writing poetry?” asked Shapiro, as he glanced
appraisingly at the haggard-eyed youth. In one
swift look he took in the shabby garments that
covered the thin body, the pride and the eagerness
of the pale, hungry face. “I guess,” added
the musician, “your poetry ain’t a very paying
proposition!”</p>

<p>Incensed at the unconscious gibe, Berel
turned with a supercilious curl of his lips.</p>

<p>“What’s a sport like you doing here in the
library?”</p>

<p>Shapiro pointed to a big pile of books from
the copyright office.</p>

<p>“Chasing song titles,” he said. “I’m a
melody writer. I got some wonderful tunes, and
I thought I’d get a suggestion for a theme from
these catalogues.”</p>

<p>“<i>Oi weh</i>, if for ideas you have to go to copyright
catalogues!”</p>

<p>“Man, you should see the bunch of lyric
plumbers I have to work with. They give me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
jingles and rhymes, but nothing with a real heart
thrill.” He turned on Berel with sudden interest.
“Show us some of your soul stuff.”</p>

<p>Berel handed several pages to the composer.
One after another, Shapiro read.</p>

<p>“Highbrow—over the heads of the crowd,”
was his invariable comment.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped.</p>

<p>“By heck, there’s a good idea for a sob song!
What a title—‘Aching Hearts’!” He grasped
Berel’s hand with genuine friendliness. “Your
lines have the swing I’ve been looking for.
Only a little more zip, a change here and there,
and——”</p>

<p>“Change this?” Berel snatched the verses
and put them back in his pocket. “There’s my
heart’s blood in every letter of it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s heart stuff all right,” placated the
composer, realizing a good thing, and impatient
as a hound on the scent. “Come along!” He
took Berel by the arm. “I want to read your
sob stuff to a little friend.”</p>

<p>Flattered, but vaguely apprehensive, Berel
followed Shapiro to the delectable locality known
as Tin Pan Alley, and into the inner shrine of
one of the many song houses to be found there.</p>

<p>“Maizie!” cried Shapiro to a vaudeville star<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
who had been waiting none too patiently for his
return. “I’ve found an honest-to-God poet!”</p>

<p>He introduced Berel, who blushed like a shy
young girl.</p>

<p>“So you’re a poet?” said Maizie.</p>

<p>Her eyes were pools of dancing lights as she
laughed, aware of her effect on the transfixed
youth. Berel stared in dazzled wonder at the
sudden apparition of loveliness, of joy, of life.
Soft, feminine perfume enveloped his senses.
Like a narcotic, it stole over him. It was the
first time he had ever been touched by the
seductive lure of woman.</p>

<p>Shapiro sat down at a piano, and his hands
brought from the tortured instrument a smashing
medley of syncopated tunes.</p>

<p>“This needs lyric stuff with a heartbeat in
it,” he flung over his shoulder; “and you have
just the dope.”</p>

<p>His eyes met Maizie’s significantly, and then
veered almost imperceptibly in the direction of
Berel.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, kid—vamp him! We’ve got to
have him,” was the message they conveyed to
her.</p>

<p>Maizie put her hand prettily on the youth’s
arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“With an air like that, and the right lines—oh,
boy, I’d flood Broadway with tears!”</p>

<p>Berel stood bewildered under the spell of her
showy beauty. Unconsciously his hand went to
his pocket, where lay his precious verses.</p>

<p>“I—I can’t change my lines for the mob,”
he stammered.</p>

<p>But Maizie’s little hand crept down his arm
until it, too, reached his pocket, while her face
was raised alluringly to his.</p>

<p>“Let’s see it, Mr. Poet—do, please!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a triumphant ripple of
laughter, she snatched the pages and glanced
rapidly through the song. Then, with her highly
manicured fingers, she grasped the lapels of
Berel’s coat, her eyes dancing with a coquettish
little twinkle.</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful!” she flattered. “Just give
me the chance to put it over, and all the skirts
from here to Denver will be singing it!”</p>

<p>Shapiro placed himself in front of Berel and
said with businesslike directness:</p>

<p>“I’ll advance you two hundred bucks on this
song, if you’ll put a kick in it.”</p>

<p>Two hundred dollars! The suddenness of
the overwhelming offer left Berel stunned and
speechless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“Money—<i>ach</i>, money! To get a breath of
release from want!” he thought. “Just a few
weeks away from Hanneh Breineh’s cursing and
swearing! A chance to be quiet and alone—a
place where I can have a little beauty!”</p>

<p>Shapiro, through narrowed lids, watched the
struggle that was going on in the boy. He called
for his secretary.</p>

<p>“Write out a contract,” he ordered. “Words
by Berel Pinsky—my melody.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to the poet, who stood
nervously biting his lips.</p>

<p>“If this song goes over, it’ll mean a big piece
of change for you. You get a cent and a half
on every copy. A hit sometimes goes a million
copies. Figure it out for yourself. I’m not
counting the mechanical end of it—phonograph
records—pianola rolls—hurdy-gurdies.”</p>

<p>At the word “hurdy-gurdy” an aching fear
shot through the poet’s heart. His pale face grew
paler as he met the smooth smile of the composer.</p>

<p>“Only to get a start,” he told himself,
strengthening his resolve to sell his poem with
an equal resolve never to do so again.</p>

<p>“Well?” chuckled Shapiro.</p>

<p>He drew out a thick wallet from his pocket,
and began counting out the fresh, green bills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll do it this once,” said Berel, in a scarcely
audible voice, as he pocketed the money.</p>

<p>“Gassed with gold!” exulted Shapiro to
Maizie after Berel left. “He’s ours body and
soul—bought and paid for!”</p>


<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p>Hanneh Breineh’s lodging-house was in a
hubbub of excitement. A limousine had stopped
before the dingy tenement, and Berel—a Berel
from another world—stepped into the crowded
kitchen.</p>

<p>How he was dressed! His suit was of the
latest cut. The very quality of his necktie told
of the last word in grooming. The ebony cane
hanging on his arm raised him in the eyes of the
admiring boarders to undreamed-of heights of
wealth.</p>

<p>There was a new look in his eyes—the look
of the man who has arrived and who knows that
he has. Gone was the gloom of the insulted
and the injured. Success had blotted out the
ethereal, longing gaze of the hungry ghetto
youth. Nevertheless, to a discerning eye, a
lurking discontent, like a ghost at a feast, still
cast its shadow on Berel’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>“He’s not happy. He’s only putting on,”
thought Moisheh, casting sidelong glances at his
brother.</p>

<p>“You got enough to eat, and it shows on you
so quick,” purred Hanneh Breineh, awed into
ingratiating gentleness by Berel’s new prosperity.</p>

<p>With a large-hearted gesture, Berel threw a
handful of change into the air for the children.
There was a wild scramble of tangled legs and
arms, and then a rush to the street for the nearest
pushcart.</p>

<p>“Oi weh!” Hanneh Breineh touched Berel
with reverent gratitude. “Give a look only how
he throws himself around with his money!”</p>

<p>Berel laughed gleefully, a warm glow coming
to his heart at this bubbling appreciation of his
generosity.</p>

<p>“Hanneh Breineh,” he said, with an impressive
note in his voice, “did you ever have a
twenty-dollar gold piece in your hand?”</p>

<p>An intake of breath was the only answer.</p>

<p>“Here it is.”</p>

<p>Berel took from his pocket a little satin case
and handed it to her, his face beaming with the
lavishness of the gift.</p>

<p>Hanneh Breineh gazed at the gold piece,
which glistened with unbelievable solidity before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
her enraptured eyes. Then she fell on Berel’s
neck.</p>

<p>“You diamond prince!” she gushed.
“Always I stood for your part when they all said
you was crazy!”</p>

<p>The lean, hungry-faced boarders drank him
in, envious worship in their eyes.</p>

<p>“Rockefeller—Vanderbilt!”</p>

<p>Exclamations of wonder and awe leaped from
lip to lip as they gazed at this Midas who was
once a <i>schnorrer</i> in their midst.</p>

<p>Basking in their adulation like a bright lizard
in the sun, Berel, with feigned indifference,
lighted a thick cigar. He began to hum airily
one of his latest successes.</p>

<p>“Ten thousand dollars for my last song!”
he announced casually, as he puffed big rings of
smoke to the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Riches rains on you!” Hanneh Breineh
threw up her hands in an abandon of amazement.
“Sing to me only that millionaires’ song!”</p>

<p>Lifting her ragged skirts, she began to step
in time to the tune that Berel hummed.</p>

<p>Out of all the acclaimers Moisheh remained
the only unresponsive figure in the room.</p>

<p>“Why your long face?” Hanneh Breineh
shrieked. “What thunder fell on you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>Moisheh shifted uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what is with me the matter. I
don’t get no feelings from the words. It’s only
boom—boom—nothing!”</p>

<p>“Is ten thousand dollars nothing?” demanded
the outraged Hanneh Breineh. “Are
a million people crazy? All America sings his
songs, and you turn up your nose on them.
What do you know from life? You sweat from
morning till night pressing out your heart’s blood
on your ironing board, and what do you get from
it? A crooked back—a dried out herring face!”</p>

<p>“‘The prosperity of fools slayeth them,’”
quoted Moisheh in Hebrew.</p>

<p>Berel turned swiftly on his brother.</p>

<p>“It’s the poets who are slain and the fools
who are exalted. Before I used to spend three
months polishing one little cry from the heart.
Sometimes I sold it for five dollars, but most of
the time I didn’t. Now I shoot out a song in a
day, and it nets me a fortune!”</p>

<p>“But I would better give you the blood from
under my nails than you should sell yourself for
dollars,” replied Moisheh.</p>

<p>“Would you want me to come back to this
hell of dirt and beg from you again for every
galling bite of bread?” cried Berel, flaring into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
rage. “Your gall should burst, you dirt-eating
muzhik!” he shouted with unreasoning fury, and
fled headlong from the room.</p>

<p>This unaccountable anger from the new
millionaire left all but Hanneh Breineh in a
stupor of bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Muzhik! Are we all muzhiks, then?” she
cried. A biting doubt of the generosity of her
diamond prince rushed through her. “Twenty
dollars only from so many thousands? What if
he did dress out his stingy present in a satin
box?”</p>

<p>She passed the gold piece around disdainfully.</p>

<p>“After all, I can’t live on the shine from it.
What’ll it buy me—only twenty dollars? I done
enough for him when he was a starving beggar
that he shouldn’t be such a piker to me!”</p>


<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p>A night of carousing had just ended. Berel
Pinsky looked about his studio. Wineglasses
were strewn about. Hairpins and cigarette ashes
littered the floor. A woman’s rainbow-coloured
scarf, reeking with tobacco smoke and perfume,
lay wantonly across the piano keys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>He strode to the window and raised the shade,
but quickly pulled it down again. The sunlight
hurt him. The innocent freshness of the morning
blew accusingly against his hot brow.</p>

<p>He threw himself on the couch, but he could
not rest. Like a distorted mirror, his mind
reflected the happenings of the night before.</p>

<p>A table decked with flowers and glittering
with silver and glass swam in vinous streaks of
purple and amber. Berel saw white shoulders
and sinuous arms—women’s soft flesh against the
black background of men’s dress coats.</p>

<p>One mocking moment rose out of the reeling
picture. A bright head pressed against his breast.
His arms encircled a slender silken body. Pinnacled
high above the devouring faces of his
guests, hectic verses sputtered from his lips with
automatic fluency.</p>

<p>It was this scene, spurting out of his blurred
vision, that stabbed him like a hidden enemy
within his soul. He had prostituted the divine
in him for the swinish applause of the mob!</p>

<p>“God help me! God help me!” His body
swayed back and forth in dumb, driven helplessness.
“My sin!” he moaned, and sank to his
knees.</p>

<p>Unconsciously he recalled the ritual chant of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
the Hebrews on the Day of Atonement—a chant
he had not heard since he was a little child in
Russia.</p>

<p>“‘My sin—the sin I committed wilfully and
the sin without will. Behold, I am like a vessel
filled with shame and confusion!’”</p>

<p>As he repeated the chant, beating his breast,
his heart began to swell and heave with the old
racial hunger for purging, for cleanness.</p>

<p>“My sin!” he cried. “I took my virgin gift
of song and dragged it through the mud of
Broadway!”</p>

<p>His turbulent penance burst into sobs—broke
through the parched waste within him. From
afar off a phrase fragrant as dew, but vague and
formless, trembled before him. With a surge of
joy, he seized pencil and paper. Only to catch
and voice the first gush of his returning spirit!</p>

<p>“Wake up, you nut!”</p>

<p>Shapiro had come in unobserved, and stood
before him like a grinning Mephistopheles. Berel
looked up, startled. The air boiled before him.</p>

<p>“See here—we got the chance of our life!”
Shapiro, in his enthusiasm, did not notice Berel’s
grim mood. He shook the poet by the shoulder.
“Ten thousand bucks, and not a worry in your
bean! Just sign your name to this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>With a shudder of shame, Berel glanced at
the manuscript and flung it from him.</p>

<p>“Sign my name to this trash?”</p>

<p>“Huh! You’re mighty squeamish all of a
sudden!”</p>

<p>“I can’t choke no more my conscience.”</p>

<p>“Conscience, rot! If we can’t get the dope
from you, I tell you, we got to get it from somebody
else till you get back on the job!”</p>

<p>A cloud seemed to thicken Berel’s glance.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said, taking from his desk his last
typewritten songs, “I’ve done my level best to
grind this out.”</p>

<p>Shapiro grasped the sheets with quickening
interest. He read, and then shook his head with
grieved finality.</p>

<p>“It’s no use. It’s not in you any more.
You’ve lost the punch.”</p>

<p>“You mean to tell me that my verses wouldn’t
go?”</p>

<p>Berel’s eyes shone like hot coals out of his
blanched face.</p>

<p>“Look here, old pal,” replied Shapiro, with
patronizing pity. “You’ve just gone dry.”</p>

<p>“You ghoul!” Berel lifted his fist threateningly.
“It’s you who worked me dry—made of
my name nothing but a trade-mark!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“So that’s what I get for all I done for you!”
Revulsion at the boy’s ingratitude swept through
Shapiro like a fury. “What do you think I am?
Business is business. If you ain’t got the dope
no more, why, you ain’t better than the bunch of
plumbers that I chucked!”</p>

<p>With a guttural cry, Berel hurled himself
forward like a tiger.</p>

<p>“You bloodsucker, you!”</p>

<p>A shriek from Maizie standing in the doorway.
A whirling figure in chiffon and furs thrust
itself between them, the impact pushing Shapiro
back.</p>

<p>“Baby darling, you’re killing me!” Soft
arms clung about Berel’s neck. “You don’t
want to hurt nobody—you know you don’t—and
you make me cry!”</p>

<p>Savagely Berel thrust the girl’s head
back and looked into her eyes. His face
flashed with the shame of the betrayed manhood
in him.</p>

<p>“I was a poet before you smothered my fire
with your jazz!”</p>

<p>For an instant Maizie’s features froze,
terrified by an anger that she could not comprehend.
Then she threw herself on his shoulder
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>“But it’s in rehearsal—booked to the coast.
It’s all up with me unless you sign!”</p>

<p>He felt her sobs pounding away his anger.
A hated tenderness slowly displaced his fury.
Unwillingly, his arms clasped her closer.</p>

<p>“This once, but never again,” he breathed in
her ear as he crushed her to him.</p>

<p>Gently Maizie extricated herself, with a smile
shining through her tear-daubed face.</p>

<p>“You darling old pet! I’ll be grateful till
I die,” she said, thrusting the pen into Berel’s
hand.</p>

<p>With tragic acceptance of his weakness, Berel
scrawled his well-known signature on one sheet
after another. With a beaten look of hatred
he handed them to Shapiro, now pacified and
smiling.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Long after they had gone, Berel still sat in
the same chair. He made no move. He uttered
no sound. With doubled fists thrust between his
knees, he sat there, his head sunk on his breast.</p>

<p>In the depths of his anguish a sudden light
flashed. He picked up the rejected songs and
read them with regained understanding. All the
cheap triteness, the jazz vulgarity of the lines,
leaped at him and hit him in the face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>“Pfui!” he laughed with bitter loathing, as
he flung the tawdry verses from him.</p>

<p>Like a prisoner unbound, he sprang to his
feet. He would shake himself free from the
shackles of his riches! All this clutter of things
about him—this huge, stuffy house with its useless
rooms—the servants—his limousine—each
added luxury was only another bar shutting him
out from the light.</p>

<p>For an instant he pondered how to get rid of
his stifling wealth. Should he leave it to Moisheh
or Hanneh Breineh? No—they should not be
choked under this mantle of treasure that had
nearly choked the life in him.</p>

<p>A flash of inspiration—Maizie! God help
her, poor life-loving Maizie! He would
give it to her outright—everything, down to
the last kitchen pot—only to be a free man
again!</p>

<p>As quick as thought Berel scribbled a note
to his lawyer, directing him to carry out this reckless
whim. Then he went to the closet where, out
of some strange, whimsical sentiment, he still
kept his shabby old coat and hat. In a moment
he was the old Berel again. Still in his frenzy,
he strode towards the door.</p>

<p>“Back—back to Hanneh Breineh—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
Moisheh—back to my own people! Free—free!”</p>

<p>He waved his hands exultantly. The walls
resounded with his triumphant laughter. Grasping
his shabby old cap in his hand, he raised it
high over his head and slammed the gold-panelled
door behind him with a thundering
crash.</p>


<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p>“Last lot cheap! Apples sweet like honey!”</p>

<p>“Fish, live, fresh fish!”</p>

<p>“Shoe laces, matches, pins!”</p>

<p>The raucous orchestra of voices rose and fell
in whining, blatant discord. Into the myriad
sounds the rumbling Elevated bored its roaring
thunder. Dirty, multi-coloured rags—the pinions
of poverty—fluttered from the crowded windows.
Streams of human atoms surged up and down
the side-walk littered with filth. Horses and
humans pounded and scuttled through the middle
of the street.</p>

<p>Berel’s face shone exultant out of the crowd.
In the quickening warmth of this old, familiar
poverty his being expanded and breathed in huge
drafts of air. The jostling mass of humanity that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
pressed about him was like the close embrace of
countless friends.</p>

<p><i>Ach</i>, here in this elemental struggle for
existence was the reality he was seeking! It
cried to him out of the dirty, driven faces. Here
was the life that has never yet been fully lived.
Here were the songs that have not yet been
adequately sung.</p>

<p>“A black year on you, robber, swindler! If
I go to buy rotten apples, should you charge me
for fruit from heaven?”</p>

<p>The familiar voice shot like a bolt to his
awakening heart. He looked up to see Hanneh
Breineh’s ragged figure wedged in between two
pushcarts, her face ecstatic with the zest of
bargaining.</p>

<p>“Hanneh Breineh!” he cried, seizing her
market basket, and almost throwing himself on
her neck in a rush of exuberant affection. “I’ve
come back to you and Moisheh!”</p>

<p>“God from the world! What’s this—you in
rags?” A quick look of suspicion crept into her
face. “Did you lose your money? Did you
maybe play cards?”</p>

<p>“I left it all to her—you know—every cent
of the ill-gotten money.”</p>

<p>“Left your money to that doll’s face?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>Hanneh clutched her head and peered at him
out of her red-lidded eyes.</p>

<p>“Where’s Moisheh?” Berel asked.</p>

<p>He came closer to her, his whole face expressing
the most childlike faith in her acceptance of
his helplessness, in the assurance of her welcome.</p>

<p>“Don’t you yet know the pants pressers was
on a strike, and he owed me the rent for so long
he went away from shame?”</p>

<p>“But where is he—my brother?” cried Berel
in despair.</p>

<p>“The devil knows, not me. I only know he
owes me the rent!”</p>

<p>“Moisheh gone?” He felt the earth slipping
from under him. He seized Hanneh Breineh’s
hand imploringly. “You can squeeze me in
with the other boarders—put me up on chairs—over
the washtub—anywhere. I got no one
but you!”</p>

<p>“No one but me?” Thrusting him down to
his knees, she towered above him like some
serpent-headed fury. “What did you ever done
for me when you had it good that I should take
pity on you now? Why was you such a stingy
to me when you were rolling yourself in riches?”</p>

<p>Her voice came in thick gusts of passion, as
the smouldering feeling of past neglect burst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
from her in volcanic wrath. “You black-hearted
<i>schnorrer</i>, you!”</p>

<p>A crowd of neighbours and passers-by, who
had gathered at her first cursing screams, now
surged closer. With her passion for harangue,
she was lifted to sublime heights of vituperative
eloquence by her sensation-hungry audience.</p>

<p>“People! Give a look only! This soft
idiot throws away all his money on a doll’s face,
and then wants me to take the bread from the
mouths of my own children to feed him!” She
shook her fist in Berel’s face. “Loafer—liar!
I was always telling you your bad end!”</p>

<p>A hoarse voice rose from the crowd.</p>

<p>“Pfui! the rotten rich one!”</p>

<p>“He used to blow from himself like a Vanderbilt!”</p>

<p>“Came riding around in automobiles!”</p>

<p>All the pent-up envy that they never dared
express while he was in power suddenly found
voice.</p>

<p>“He’s crazy—<i>meshugeh</i>!”</p>

<p>The mob took up the abuse and began to
press closer. A thick piece of mud from an unknown
hand flattened itself on the ashen cheek
of the shaken poet. Instantly the lust for persecution
swept the crowd. Mud rained on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
crouching figure in their midst. Hoarse invectives,
shrieks, infamous laughter rose from the
mob, now losing all control.</p>

<p>With the look of a hunted beast, Berel drove
his way through the merciless crowd. His clothing
swirled in streaming rags behind him as he
fled on, driven by the one instinct to escape alive.</p>

<p>When he had outdistanced those who
pursued, he dropped in a dark hallway of an
alley. Utter exhaustion drained him of all
thought, all feeling.</p>

<p>Dawn came. Still Berel slept. From the
near-by street the clattering of a morning milk
wagon roused him slightly. He stirred painfully,
then sank back into a dream which grew
as vivid as life.</p>

<p>He saw himself a tiny, black ant in an ant-hill.
While plodding toilfully with the teeming
hive, he suddenly ventured on a path of his own.
Then a huge, destroying force overwhelmed and
crushed him, to the applause of the other ants,
slaves of their traditional routine.</p>

<p>The pounding of a hammer rang above his
head. He opened his eyes. A man was nailing
a sign to the doorway into which he had sunk the
night before. Berel rubbed his heavy-lidded
eyes and, blinking, read the words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>MACHINE HANDS WANTED</p>
</div>

<p>“Food! <i>Oi weh</i>, a bite to eat! A job should
I take?”</p>

<p>The disjointed thoughts of his tired brain
urged him to move. He tried to rise, but he
ached in every limb. The pain in his stiff body
brought back to him the terror through which he
had lived the day before. More than starvation,
he feared the abyss of madness that yawned
before him.</p>

<p>“Machine hand—anything,” he told himself.
“Only to be sane—only to be like the rest—only
to have peace!”</p>

<p>This new humility gave him strength. He
mounted the stairs of the factory and took his
place in the waiting line of applicants for work.</p>


<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p>For weeks Berel Pinsky worked, dull and inanimate
as the machines he had learned to drive.
Work, eat, sleep—eat, sleep, work. Day after
day he went to and from his hall bedroom, day
after day to and from the shop.</p>

<p>He had ceased to struggle. He had ceased
to be an individual, a soul apart. He was a piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
of a mass, a cog of a machine, an ant of an ant
hill. Individually he was nothing—they were
nothing. Together they made up the shop.</p>

<p>So he went on. Inert, dumb as a beast in a
yoke, he brushed against his neighbours. He
never talked. As if in a dream, he heard the
shrill babble of the other shop hands rise above
the roaring noises of the machines.</p>

<p>One day, while eating his scanty lunch, lost
in a dull, wandering daydream, he felt a movement
at his elbow. Looking up, he saw Sosheh,
the finisher, furtively reaching for a crust that had
dropped from his thick slice of bread.</p>

<p>“You don’t want it yet?” she questioned, her
face colouring with confusion.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, surprised out of his
silence. “But didn’t you have any lunch?”</p>

<p>“I’m saving myself from my lunches to buy
me a red feather on my new spring hat.”</p>

<p>He looked at Sosheh curiously, and noticed
for the first time the pinched look of the pale
young face.</p>

<p>“Red over that olive paleness!” he
mused. “How bright and singing that colour
would be!”</p>

<p>Moved by an impulse of friendliness, he
pushed an apple towards her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“Take it,” he said. “I had one for my lunch
already.”</p>

<p>He watched her with smiling interest as she
bit hungrily into the juicy fruit.</p>

<p>“Will your feather be as red as this apple?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“<i>Ach!</i>” she said, with her mouth full. “If
you could only give a look how that feather is to
me becoming! The redness waves over my black
hair like waves from red wine!”</p>

<p>“Why, that girl is a poet!” he thought,
thrilled by the way her mind leaped in her dumb
yearning for beauty.</p>

<p>The next noon she appeared with a paper bag
in her hand. Reverently she drew forth a bright
red cock’s feather.</p>

<p>“Nu, ain’t it grand? For two weeks my lunch
money it is.”</p>

<p>“How they want to shine, the driven things,
even in the shop!” he mused. “Starving for a
bit of bright colour—denying themselves food for
the shimmering touch of a little beauty!”</p>

<p>One morning, when he had risen to go to work
in the grey dawn, he found his landlady bending
over an ironing board in the dim gaslight, pressing
a child’s white dress. She put down the iron
to give Berel his breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“My little Gittel is going to speak a piece to-day.”
Her face glowed as she showed him the
frock. “Give a look only on those flowers I
stitched out myself on the sash. Don’t they smell
almost the fields to you?”</p>

<p>He gazed in wonder at the mother’s face
beaming down at him. How could Tzipeh
Yenteh still sense the perfume of the fields in
this dead grind of work? How could his care-crushed
landlady, with seven hungry mouths to
feed—how could she still reach out for the
beautiful? His path to work was lit up by
Tzipeh Yenteh’s face as she showed him her
Gittel’s dress in all its freshness.</p>

<p>Little by little he found himself becoming
interested in the people about him. Each had
his own hidden craving. Each one longed for
something beautiful that was his and no one
else’s.</p>

<p>Beauty—beauty! <i>Ach</i>, the lure of it, the
tender hope of it! How it filled every heart with
its quickening breath! It made no difference
what form it took—whether it was the craving for
a bright feather, a passion for an ideal, or the love
of man for woman. Behind it all was the same
flaming hope, the same deathless outreaching for
the higher life!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>God, what a song to sing! The imperishable
glamour of beauty, painting the darkest sweatshop
in rainbow colours of heaven, splashing the
gloom of the human ant-hill with the golden pigments
of sunrise and sunset!</p>

<p>Lifted to winged heights by the onrush of this
new vision, Berel swept home with the other
toilers pouring from shops and factories.</p>

<p>How thankful he was for the joy of his bleak
little room! He shut the door, secure in his
solitude. Voices began to speak to him. Faces
began to shine for him—the dumb, the oppressed,
the toil-driven multitudes who lived and breathed
unconscious of the cryings-out in them. All the
thwarted longings of their lives, all the baffled
feelings of their hearts, all the aching dumbness
of their lips, rose to his sympathetic lips, singing
the song of the imperishable soul in them.</p>

<p>Berel thought how Beethoven lay prone on
the ground, his deaf ears hearing the beat of
insects’ wings, the rustle of grass, the bloom of
buds, all the myriad voices of the pregnant earth.
For the first time since the loss of his gift in the
jazz pit of Tin Pan Alley, the young poet heard
the rhythm of divine creation.</p>

<p>He drew a sheet of white paper before his
eyes. From his trembling fingers flowed a poem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
that wrote its own music—every line a song—the
whole a symphony of his regeneration.</p>

<p>“To think that I once despised them—my
own people!” he mused. “<i>Ach</i>, I was too dense
with young pride to see them then!”</p>

<p>His thoughts digging down into the soil of his
awakened spirit, he cried aloud:</p>

<p>“Beauty is everywhere, but I can sing it only
of my own people. Some one will find it even
in Tin Pan Alley—among Maizie’s life-loving
crowd; but I, in this life, must be the poet of the
factories—of my own East Side!”</p>


<h3>§ 7</h3>

<p>“It’s me—Hanneh Breineh!”</p>

<p>A loud thumping at the door and a shrill
chatter of voices broke in upon Berel’s meditations.</p>

<p>“Me—Moisheh!”</p>

<p>“Come in!” he cried, welcoming this human
inbreak after his long vigil.</p>

<p>“Here we got him!” Berel was smothered
in Hanneh Breineh’s gushing embrace. “Where
did you run away that time, you crazy? Don’t
you yet know my bitter heart? I never mean
nothing when I curse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>“For months it dried out our eyes from our
heads looking for you,” gulped Moisheh, tearing
him from Hanneh’s greedy arms.</p>

<p>Berel fell on his brother’s neck, weeping out
the whole rush and tide of his new-born humility.</p>

<p>“Mine own brother, with the old shine from
his eyes!”</p>

<p>Moisheh held Berel off, then crushed him in
another long hug. Hanneh Breineh, with ostentatious
importance, held up her capacious market
basket and drew forth a greasy bundle.</p>

<p>“Let’s make from it a holiday, for good luck.
It’s only a bargain, this apple strudel,” she said
apologetically, breaking it in pieces and giving
one to each.</p>

<p>Berel’s tears rang out in laughter.</p>

<p>“My own hearts—my own people!”</p>

<p>“<i>Mazeltuf!</i> Good luck!” chanted Hanneh
Breineh, sipping hungrily the last drops of
luscious juice that oozed from the apple strudel.</p>

<p>Raising his piece on high, Moisheh chimed
in:</p>

<p>“Good luck and the new life!”</p>

</div>


<p>One glance at his wife’s tight-drawn mouth
warned Reb Ravinsky of the torrent of
wrath about to burst over his head.</p>

<p>“Nu, my bread-giver? Did you bring me
the rent?” she hurled at him between clenched
teeth.</p>

<p>Reb Ravinsky had promised to borrow money
that morning to ward off their impending eviction
for unpaid rent, but no sooner had he stepped
out of his house than all thought of it fled from
his mind. Instinctively, he turned to the synagogue
where he had remained all day absorbed in
the sacred script. It was easier to pray and
soar the heights with the prophets of his race
than to wrestle with sordid, earthly cares.</p>

<p>“Holy Jew! Why didn’t you stay away a
little longer?” She tore at her wig in her fury.
“Are you a man like other men? Does your
wife or your child lay in your head at all? I
got to worry for rent. I got to worry for bread.
If you got to eat you eat. If you ain’t got to
eat you ain’t hungry. You fill yourself only with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
high thoughts. You hold yourself only with
God. Your wife and your child can be thrown
in the street to shame and to laughter. But
what do you care? You live only for the next
world. You got heaven in your head. The rest
of your family can rot in the streets.”</p>

<p>Reb Ravinsky stood mute and helpless under
the lash of her tongue. But when she had exhausted
her store of abuse, he cast upon her a
look of scorn and condemnation.</p>

<p>“<i>Ishah Rah!</i> Evil woman!” he turned upon
her like an ancient prophet denouncing ungodliness.</p>

<p>“<i>Ishah Rah!</i>” he repeated. His voice of
icy passion sent shivers up and down her spine.</p>

<p>“<i>Ishah Rah!</i>” came for the third time with
the mystic solemnity that subdued her instantly
into worshipful subjection. “Tear away your
man from God! Tear him away from the holy
Torah! Lose the one precious thing in life,
the one thing that makes a Jew stand out over
all other nations of the world, the one thing that
the Tsar’s <i>pogroms</i> and all the sufferings and
murders of the Jews could not kill in the Jew—the
hope for the next world!”</p>

<p>Like a towering spirit of righteousness afire
with the Word of God he loomed over her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>“I ask you by your conscience, should I give
up the real life, the true life, for good eating,
good sleeping, for a life in the body like the
<i>Amoratzim</i> here in America? Should I make
from the Torah a pick with which to dig for you
the rent?”</p>

<p>Adjusting his velvet skull-cap, the last relic
of his rabbinical days, he caught the woman’s
adoring look. Memories of his past splendour
in Russia surged over him. He saw his people
coming to him from far and near to learn wisdom
from his lips. Drawing himself to his full height,
he strode across the room and faced her.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you marry yourself to a tailor,
a shoemaker, a thick-head, a money-maker—to
a man of the flesh—a rabbi who can sell his
religion over the counter as a butcher sells
meat?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ravinsky gazed with fear and contrition
at her husband’s God-kindled face. She loved
him because he was <i>not</i> a man of this world.
Her darkest moments were lit up with pride in
him, with the hope that in the next world the
reflected glory of his piety might exalt her.</p>

<p>It wrung her heart to realize that against her
will she was dragging him down with her ceaseless
demands for bread and rent. Ach! Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
was there such an evil thing as money in this
world? Why did she have to torture her husband
with earthly needs when all she longed for
was to help him win a higher place in heaven?</p>

<p>Tears fell from her faded eyes. He could
have wept with her—it hurt him so to make her
suffer. But once and for all he must put a stop
to her nagging. He must cast out the evil spirit
of worry that possessed her lest it turn and rend
him.</p>

<p>“Why are you killing yourself so for this
life? <i>Ut!</i> See, death is already standing over
you. One foot is already in the grave. Do
you know what you’ll get for making nothing
from the Torah? The fires of hell are waiting
for you! Wait—wait! I warn you!”</p>

<p>And as though to ward off the evil that threatened
his house, he rushed to his shrine of sacred
books and pulled from its niche a volume of his
beloved Talmud. With reverence he caressed
its worn and yellowed pages as he drank in
hungrily the inspired words. For a few blessed
moments he took refuge from all earthly storms.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In Schnipishock, Reb Ravinsky had been a
<i>porush</i>, a pensioned scholar. The Jews of the
village so deeply appreciated his learning and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
piety that they granted him an allowance, so
as to free the man of God from all earthly
cares.</p>

<p>Arrived in the new world, he soon learned
that there was no honoured pension forthcoming
to free him from the world of the flesh. For a
time he eked out a bare living by teaching
Hebrew to private scholars. But the opening of
the Free Hebrew Schools resulted in the loss of
most of his pupils.</p>

<p>He had been chosen by God to spread the
light of the Torah—and a living must come to
him, somehow, somewhere, if he only served
faithfully.</p>

<p>In the meantime, how glorious it was to suffer
hunger and want, even shame and derision, yet
rise through it all as Job had risen and proclaim
to the world: “I know that my Redeemer
liveth!”</p>

<p>Reb Ravinsky was roused from his ecstasy
by his wife’s loud sobbing. Thrust out from
the haven of his Torah, he closed the book and
began to pace the floor.</p>

<p>“Can fire and water go together? Neither
can godliness and an easy life. If you have eyes
of flesh and are blind, should I fall into your
blindness? You care only for what you can put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
in your mouth or wear on your back; I struggle
for the life that is together with God!”</p>

<p>“My rent—have you my rent? I warned
you!” The landlord pushed through the half-open
door flaunting his final dispossess notice
under Reb Ravinsky’s nose. “I got orders to
put you out,” he gloated, as he motioned to his
men to proceed with the eviction.</p>

<p>Reb Ravinsky gripped the back of a chair for
support.</p>

<p>“Oi-i-i! Black is me! Bitter is me!”
groaned his wife, leaning limply against the
wall.</p>

<p>For weeks she had been living in momentary
dread of this catastrophe. Now, when the burly
moving men actually broke into her home, she
surrendered herself to the anguish of utter
defeat. She watched them disconnect the rusty
stove and carry it into the street. They took the
bed, the Passover dishes prayerfully wrapped to
avoid the soil of leavened bread. They took the
brass samovar and the Sabbath candlesticks. And
she stood mutely by—defenceless—impotent!</p>

<p>“What did I sin?” The cry broke from
her. “God! God! Is there a God over us
and sees all this?”</p>

<p>The men and the things they touched were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
to Reb Ravinsky’s far-seeing eyes as shadows of
the substanceless dream of life in the flesh.
With vision focused on the next world, he saw
in dim blurs the drama enacted in this world.</p>

<p>Smash to the floor went the sacred Sabbath
wineglass! Reb Ravinsky turned sharply, in
time to see a man tumble ruthlessly the sacred
Hebrew books to the floor.</p>

<p>A flame of holy wrath leaped from the old
man’s eyes. His breath came in convulsive
gasps as he clutched with emaciated fingers at
his heart. The sacrilege of the ruffians! He
rushed to pick up the books, kissing each volume
with pious reverence. As he gathered them in
his trembling arms, he looked about confusedly
for a safe hiding-place. In his anxiety for the
safety of his holy treasure, he forgot the existence
of his wife and ran with his books to the synagogue
as one runs from a house on fire. So overwrought
was he that he nearly fell over his little
daughter running up the stairs.</p>

<p>“Murderer!” screamed Mrs. Ravinsky, after
him. “Run, run to the synagogue! Holy Jew!
See where your religion has brought us. Run—ask
God to pay your rent!”</p>

<p>She turned to her little Rachel who burst
into the room terrified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>“See, my heart! See what they’ve done to
us! And your father ran to hide himself in the
synagogue. You got no father—nobody to give
you bread. A lost orphan you are.”</p>

<p>“Will the charity lady have to bring us eating
again?” asked Rachel, her eyes dilated with
dread. “Wait only till I get old enough to go
to the shop and earn money.” And she reached
up little helpless arms protectingly.</p>

<p>The child’s sympathy was as salt on the
mother’s wounds.</p>

<p>“For what did we come to America?”</p>

<p>The four walls of her broken home stared
back their answer.</p>

<p>Only the bundles of bedding remained, which
Rachel guarded with fierce defiance as though
she would save it from the wreckage.</p>

<p>Pushing the child roughly aside, the man
slung it over his shoulder. Mrs. Ravinsky, with
Rachel holding on to her skirts, felt her way after
him down the dark stairway.</p>

<p>“My life! My blood! My feather bed!”
she cried, as he tossed the family heirloom into
the gutter. “Gevalt!” prostrate, she fell on it.
“How many winters it took my mother to pick
together the feathers! My mother’s wedding
present....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>From the stoops, the alleys and the doorways
the neighbours gathered. Hanneh Breineh, followed
by her clinging brood, pushed through the
throng, her red-lidded eyes big with compassion.
“Come the while in by me.”</p>

<p>She helped the grief-stricken woman to her
feet. “We’re packed like herrings in a barrel,
but there’s always room for a push-in of a few
more.”</p>

<p>Lifting the feather bed under her arm she led
the way to her house.</p>

<p>“In a few more years your Rachel will be
old enough to get her working papers and all
your worries for bread will be over,” she encouraged,
as she opened the door of her stuffy
little rooms.</p>

<p>The commotion on the street corner broke in
upon the babble of gossiping women in the
butcher shop. Mr. Sopkin paused in cutting
the meat.</p>

<p>“Who did they make to move?” he asked,
joining the gesticulating mob at the doorway.</p>

<p>“<i>Oi weh!</i> Reb Ravinsky?”</p>

<p>“God from the sky! Such a good Jew!
Such a light for the world!”</p>

<p>“Home, in Russia, they kissed the ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
on which he walked, and in America they throw
him in the street!”</p>

<p>“Who cares in America for religion? In
America everybody has his head in his belly.”</p>

<p>“Poor little Rachel! Such a smart child!
Writes letters for everybody on the block.”</p>

<p>“Such a lazy do-nothing! All day in the
synagogue!” flung the pawnbroker’s wife, a big-bosomed
woman, her thick fingers covered with
diamonds. “Why don’t he go to work in a
shop?”</p>

<p>A neighbour turned upon her. “Hear!
Hear her only! Such a pig-eater! Such a fat-head!
She dares take Reb Ravinsky’s name in
her mouth.”</p>

<p>“Who was she from home? A water-carrier’s
wife, a cook! And in America she
makes herself for a person—shines up the street
with her diamonds.”</p>

<p>“Then leave somebody let know the charities.”
With a gesture of self-defence, the pawnbroker’s
wife fingered her gold beads. “I’m a
lady-member from the charities.”</p>

<p>“The charities? A black year on them!”
came a chorus of angry voices.</p>

<p>“All my enemies should have to go to the
charities for help.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>“Woe to anyone who falls into the charities’
hands!”</p>

<p>“One poor man with a heart can help more
than the charities with all their money.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sopkin hammered on his chopping-block,
his face purple with excitement. “<i>Weiber!</i> with
talk alone you can’t fill up the pot.”</p>

<p>“<i>Takeh! Takeh!</i>” Eager faces strained
forward. “Let’s put ourselves together for a
collection.”</p>

<p>“I’m not yet making Rockefeller’s millions
from the butcher business, but still, here’s my
beginning for good luck.” And Mr. Sopkin
tossed a dollar bill into the basket on the
counter.</p>

<p>A woman, a ragged shawl over her head,
clutched a quarter in her gaunt hand. “God is
my witness! To tear out this from my pocket is
like tearing off my right hand. I need every cent
to keep the breath in the bodies of my <i>kinder</i>,
but how can we let such a holy Jew fall in the
street?”</p>

<p>“My enemies should have to slave with such
bitter sweat for every penny as me.” Hannah
Hayyeh flung out her arms still wet with soapsuds
and kissed the ten-cent piece she dropped
into the collection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Sopkin walked to the sidewalk and
shook the basket in front of the passers-by.
“Take your hand out from your pocket! Take
your bite away from your mouth! Who will
help the poor if not the poor?”</p>

<p>A shower of coins came pouring in. It
seemed not money—but the flesh and blood of
the people—each coin a part of a living heart.</p>

<p>The pawnbroker’s wife, shamed by the surging
generosity of the crowd, grudgingly peeled
a dollar from the roll of bills in her stocking
and started to put it into the collection.</p>

<p>A dozen hands lifted in protest.</p>

<p>“No—no! Your money and our money
can’t mix together!”</p>

<p>“Our money is us—our bodies! Yours is
the profits from the pawnshop! Hold your
<i>trefah</i> dollar for the charities!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Only when the Shammes, the caretaker of the
synagogue, rattling his keys, shook Reb Ravinsky
gently and reminded him that it was past closing
time did he remember that somewhere waiting
for him—perhaps still in the street—were his
wife and child.</p>

<p>The happening of the day had only deepened
the intensity with which he clung to God and His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
Torah. His lips still moved in habitual prayer
as with the guidance of neighbours he sought the
new flat which had been rented for a month with
the collection money.</p>

<p>Bread, butter, milk and eggs greeted his gaze
as he opened the door.</p>

<p>“<i>Nu</i>, my wife? Is there a God over us?”
His face kindled with guileless faith. “The
God that feeds the little fishes in the sea and the
birds in the air, has He not fed us? You see, the
Highest One takes care of our earthly needs.
Our only business here is to pray for holiness to
see His light!”</p>

<p>A cloud of gloom stared up at him out of his
wife’s darkening eyes.</p>

<p>“Why are you still so black with worry?” he
admonished. “If you would only trust yourself
on God, all good would come to us yet.”</p>

<p>“On my enemies should fall the good that
has come to us,” groaned Mrs. Ravinsky.
“Better already death than to be helped again
by the pity from kind people.”</p>

<p>“What difference how the help comes, so
long we can keep up our souls to praise God
for His mercy on us?”</p>

<p>Despair was in the look she fixed upon her
husband’s lofty brow—a brow untouched by time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
or care, smooth, calm and seamless as a child’s.
“No wonder people think that I’m your mother.
The years make you younger. You got no blood
in your body—no feelings in your heart. I got
to close my eyes with shame to pass in the street
the people what helped me, while you—you—shame
cannot shame you—poverty cannot crush
you——”</p>

<p>“Poverty? It stands in the Talmud that
poverty is an ornament on a Jew like a red ribbon
on a white horse. Those whom God chooses for
His next world can’t have it good here.”</p>

<p>“Stop feeding me with the next world!” she
flung at him in her exasperation. “Give me
something on this world.”</p>

<p>“Wait only till our American daughter will
grow up. That child has my head on her,” he
boasted with a father’s pride. “Wait only,
you’ll see the world will ring from her yet. With
the Hebrew learning I gave her, she’ll shine out
from all other American children.”</p>

<p>“But how will she be able to lift up her head
with other people alike if you depend yourself on
the charities?”</p>

<p>“Woman! Worry yourself not for our
Rachel! It stands in the Holy Book, the world
is a wheel, always turning. Those who are rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
get poor; if not they, then their children or children’s
children. And those who are poor like
us, go up higher and higher. Our daughter will
yet be so rich, she’ll give away money to the
charities that helped us. Isaiah said——”</p>

<p>“Enough—enough!” broke in Mrs. Ravinsky,
thrilled in spite of herself by the prophecies
of her holy man. “I know already all your
smartness. Go, go, sit yourself down and eat
something. You fasted all day.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mrs. Ravinsky hoarded for her husband and
child the groceries the neighbours had donated.
For herself she allowed only the left-overs, the
crumbs and crusts.</p>

<p>The following noon, after finishing her
meagre meal, she still felt the habitual gnawing
of her under-nourished body, so she took a sour
pickle and cut off another slice of bread from
the dwindling loaf. But this morsel only sharpened
her craving for more food.</p>

<p>The lingering savour of the butter and eggs
which she had saved for her family tantalized her
starved nerves. Faint and weak from the struggle
to repress her hunger, she grew reckless and for
once in her life abandoned herself to the gluttonous
indulgence of the best in her scant larder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>With shaking hand she stealthily opened the
cupboard, pilfered a knife-load of butter and
spread it thickly on a second slice of bread.
Cramming the whole into her mouth, she
snatched two eggs and broke them into the
frying-pan. The smell of the sizzling eggs filled
the air with the sweet fragrance of the Sabbath.
“Ach! How the sun would shine in my heart
if I could only allow myself the bite in my
mouth!”</p>

<p>Memories of <i>gefüllte</i> fish and the odour of
freshly-baked apple strudel dilated her nostrils.
She saw herself back in Russia setting the Sabbath
table when she was the honoured wife of
Reb Ravinsky.</p>

<p>The sudden holiday feeling that thrilled her
senses smote her conscience. “Oi weh! Sinner
that I am! Why should it will itself in me to
eat like a person when my man don’t earn enough
for dry bread? What will we do when this is
used up? Suppose the charities should catch
me feasting myself with such a full hand?”</p>

<p>Bent ravenously over the eggs—one eye on
the door—she lifted the first spoonful to her
watering mouth as Rachel flew in, eyes wide
with excitement.</p>

<p>“Mamma! The charity lady is coming!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
She’s asking the fish-pedlar on the stoop where
we live now.”</p>

<p>“Quick! Hide the frying-pan in the oven!
Woe is me! The house not swept—dishes not
washed—everything thrown around! Rachel!
Quick only—sweep together the dirt in a corner.
Throw those rags under the bed! <i>Oi weh</i>—quick—hide
all those dirty things behind the
trunk!”</p>

<p>In her haste to tidy up, she remembered the
food in the cupboard. She stuffed it—broken
eggshells and all—into the bureau drawer. “Oi
weh! The charity lady should only not catch
us with all these holiday eatings....”</p>

<p>Footsteps in the hallway and Miss Naughton’s
cheery voice: “Here I am, Mrs. Ravinsky!
What can I do to help now?”</p>

<p>With the trained eye of the investigator, she
took in the wretched furniture, scant bedding,
the under-nourished mother and child.</p>

<p>“What seems to be wrong?” Miss Naughton
drew up a three-legged stool. “Won’t you tell
me, so we can get at the root of the trouble?”
She put her hand on the woman’s apron with a
friendly little gesture.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ravinsky bit her lips to force back
the choking pressure of tears. The life, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
buoyancy, the very kindness of the “charity
lady” stabbed deeper the barb of her wretchedness.</p>

<p>“Woe is me! On all my enemies my black
heart! So many babies and young people die
every day, but no death comes to hide me from
my shame.”</p>

<p>“Don’t give way like that,” pleaded Miss
Naughton, pained by the bitterness that she tried
in vain to understand. “If you will only tell me
a few things so I may the better know how to help
you.”</p>

<p>“Again tear me in pieces with questions?”
Mrs. Ravinsky pulled at the shrunken skin of
her neck.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to pry into your personal affairs,
but if you only knew how often we’re imposed
upon. Last week we had a case of a woman who
asked us to pay her rent. When I called to
investigate, I found her cooking chicken for
dinner!”</p>

<p>The cot on which Mrs. Ravinsky sat creaked
under her swaying body.</p>

<p>“You see, we have only a small amount of
money,” went on the unconscious inquisitor,
“and it is but fair it should go to the most
deserving cases.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>Entering a few preliminary notes, Miss
Naughton looked up inquiringly. “Where is
Mr. Ravinsky?”</p>

<p>“In the synagogue.”</p>

<p>“Has he no work?”</p>

<p>“He can’t do no work. His head is on the
next world.”</p>

<p>Miss Naughton frowned. She was accustomed
to this kind of excuse. “People who are
not lazy can always find employment.”</p>

<p>Seeing Mrs. Ravinsky’s sudden pallor, she
added kindly: “You have not eaten to-day. Is
there no food in the house?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ravinsky staggered blindly to her feet.
“No—nothing—I didn’t yet eat nothing.”</p>

<p>The brooding grey of Rachel’s eyes darkened
with shame as she clutched protectingly at her
mother’s apron. The uncanny, old look of the
solemn little face seemed to brush against Miss
Naughton’s very heartstrings—to reproach the
rich vigour of her own glowing youth.</p>

<p>“Have you had any lunch, dear?” The
“charity lady’s” hand rested softly on the
tangled mat of hair.</p>

<p>“N-nothing—nothing,” the child echoed her
mother’s words.</p>

<p>Miss Naughton rose abruptly. She dared not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
let her feelings get the better of her. “I am going
to get some groceries.” She sought for an excuse
to get away for a moment from the misery that
overwhelmed her. “I’ll be back soon.”</p>

<p>“Bitter is me!” wailed Mrs. Ravinsky, as the
“charity lady” left the room. “I can never lift
up my head with other people alike. I feel myself
lower than a thief, just because I got a husband
who holds himself with God all day.”</p>

<p>She cracked the knuckles of her bony fingers.
“<i>Gottuniu!</i> Listen better to my prayer! Send
on him only a quick death. Maybe if I was a
widow, people would take pity on me and save
me from this gehenna of charity.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Ten minutes later Miss Naughton returned
with a bag of supplies. “I am going to fix some
lunch for you.” She measured cocoa into a
battered saucepan. “And soon the boy will come
with enough groceries for the whole week.”</p>

<p>“Please, please,” begged Mrs. Ravinsky. “I
can’t eat now—I can’t.”</p>

<p>“But the child? She needs nutritious food
at once.”</p>

<p>Rachel’s sunken little chest rose and fell with
her frightened heartbeat as she hid her face in
her mother’s lap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>“Small as she is, she already feels how it
hurts to swallow charity eating,” defended Mrs.
Ravinsky.</p>

<p>Miss Naughton could understand the
woman’s dislike of accepting charity. She had
coped with this pride of the poor before. But
she had no sympathy with this mother who
fostered resentment in her child towards the
help that was so urgently needed. Miss
Naughton’s long-suffering patience broke.
She turned from the stove and resolutely
continued her questioning.</p>

<p>“Has your husband tried our employment
bureau?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then send him to our office to-morrow at
nine. He can be a janitor—or a porter——”</p>

<p>“My man? My man a janitor or a porter?”
Her eyes flamed. “Do you know who was my
man in Russia? The fat of the land they brought
him just for the pleasure to listen to his learning.
Barrels full of meat, pots full of chicken fat stood
packed in my cellar. I used to make boilers of
jelly at a time. The <i>gefüllte</i> fish only I gave
away is more than the charities give out to the
poor in a month.”</p>

<p>Miss Naughton could not suppress a smile.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
“Why did you leave it, then, if it was all so
perfect?”</p>

<p>“My <i>gefüllte</i> fish! Oi-i-i! Oi-i!! My
apple strudel!” she kept repeating, unable to
tear herself away from the dream of the past.</p>

<p>“Can you live on the apple strudel you had
in Russia? In America a man must work to
support his family——”</p>

<p>“All thick-heads support their families,”
defended Reb Ravinsky’s wife. “Any fat-belly
can make money. My man is a light for the
world. He works for God who feeds even the
worms under the stone.”</p>

<p>“You send your husband to my office. I want
to have a talk with him.”</p>

<p>“To your office? <i>Gottuniu!</i> He won’t go.
In Schnipishock they came to him from the four
ends of the world. The whole town blessed itself
with his religiousness.”</p>

<p>“The first principle of religion is for a man
to provide for his family. You must do exactly
as we say—or we cannot help you.”</p>

<p>“Please, please!” Mrs. Ravinsky entreated,
cringing and begging. “We got no help from
nobody now but you. I’ll bring him to your office
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The investigator now proceeded with the irk-some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
duty of her more formal questions. “How
much rent do you pay? Do you keep any
boarders? Does your husband belong to any
society or lodge? Have you relatives who are
able to help you?”</p>

<p>“Oi-i-i! What more do you want from me?”
shrieked the distracted woman.</p>

<p>Having completed her questions, Miss
Naughton looked about the room. “I am sorry
to speak of it, but why is your flat in such disorder?”</p>

<p>“I only moved in yesterday. I didn’t get yet
time to fix it up.”</p>

<p>“But it was just as bad in the last place. If
you want our help you must do your part. Soap
and water are cheap. Anyone can be clean.”</p>

<p>The woman’s knees gave way under her, as
Miss Naughton lifted the lids from the pots on
the stove.</p>

<p>And then—<i>gevalt</i>! It grew black before Mrs.
Ravinsky’s eyes. She collapsed into a pathetic
heap to the floor. The “charity lady” opened
the oven door and exposed the tell-tale frying-pan
and the two eggs!</p>

<p>Eyes of silent condemnation scorched
through the terror-stricken creature whose teeth
chattered in a vain struggle to defend herself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
But no voice came from her tortured throat. She
could only clutch at her child in a panic of helplessness.</p>

<p>Without a word, the investigator began to
search through every nook and corner and at last
she came to the bureau drawer and found butter,
eggs, cheese, bread and even a jar of jelly.</p>

<p>“For shame!” broke from the wounded
heart of the betrayed Miss Naughton. “You—you
ask for charity!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the hall below Reb Ravinsky, returning
from the synagogue, encountered a delivery boy.</p>

<p>“Where live the Ravinskys?” the lad questioned.</p>

<p>“I’m Reb Ravinsky,” he said, leading the
way, as he saw the box of groceries.</p>

<p>Followed by the boy, Reb Ravinsky flung
open the door and strode joyfully into the room.
“Look only! How the manna is falling from
the sky!”</p>

<p>Ignoring Reb Ravinsky, Miss Naughton
motioned to the box. “Take those things right
back,” she commanded the boy.</p>

<p>“How you took me in with your hungry
look!” There was more of sorrow than scorn
in her voice. “Even teaching your child to lie—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
your husband a rabbi!—a religious man—too
holy to work! What would be left for
deserving cases if we allowed such as you to
defraud legitimate charity?”</p>

<p>With bowed head, Reb Ravinsky closed the
door after the departing visitor. The upbraidings
of the woman were like a whip-lash on his
naked flesh. His heart ached for his helpless
family. Darkness suffocated him.</p>

<p>“My hungry little lamb,” wailed his wife,
clinging to Rachel. “Where now can we turn
for bread?”</p>

<p>Compassionate hands reached out in prayer
over the grief-stricken mother and child. Reb
Ravinsky stood again as he did before his flight
to America, facing his sorrowing people. His
wife’s wailing for their lost store of bread brought
back to him the bereaved survivors of the <i>pogrom</i>—the
<i>pogrom</i> that snatched away their sons and
daughters. Afire with the faith of his race, he
chanted the age-old consolation: “The Lord
giveth; the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the
name of the Lord.”</p>
